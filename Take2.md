# The Nihilism Express

Most people know they can improve their lives by making healthier choices, being honest with themselves and others, and spending time doing things they care about. In terms of happiness, I think if any human can more or less consistently do those three things, they'll probably live a pretty good life. But obviously, it's not so easy.

For starters, life isn't fair. At any point in our lives, we can be thrust into poverty, abuse, or health issues that make realistically achieving that goal impossible. And even when the conditions _do_ seem right (stable income, healthy relationships, free time and physical well-being), many people still consistently fail to live up to their aspirations (see: me).

I saw a tweet a few years ago that said "If you're so smart, why aren't you happy?"

Ouch. As a member of the former gifted kid group, that tweet kicked me in the chest. Because I "knew":

- "I am smart"
- "I desire to be happy"
- "Smart people have the ability to achieve what they desire (if it's realistically possible)"
- "Being happy is realistically possible if the conditions are right for you to feel healthy and fulfilled"
- "I have all of the conditions necessary to feel healthy and fulfilled"

Yet, when I went in for a reality checkup, it turned to me and said, "Sorry mate, we double-checked the records: You're not happy."

##### Cognitive dissonance, cannot compute

But the answer is obvious, right? I must just be missing some more conditions! And so, as any smart person would do, I tottered off to the self-help section to find someone who had the secret missing ingredient.
