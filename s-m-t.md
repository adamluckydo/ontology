# Science, Memetics, and Truth

Desperately reaching, you slam your fist into the ground, the flagpole in your hand digging into the earth. You look up; the red triangle at the top of the pole flaps nonchalantly in the breeze. A moment passes between you and the gently waving fabric.

Your footing slips, and you tumble back from whence you came. The moment is gone. The mountain remains.

The flag, too, remains.

Frisson is one of my favorite feelings. Technically it's probably better classified as a sensation or a phenomenon, since it comes bundled with goosebumps and a release of adrenaline, but the feeling is the important part. When I think of frisson, it's inseparable from the idea of putting my whole being on the line. Not dissimilar to the idea of Mêtis.

At the risk of being very "valedictorian's first speech", the Wikipedia page on frisson does have a really interesting bit:

Typical stimuli include loud passages of music and passages—such as appoggiaturas and sudden modulation—that violate some level of musical expectation. While frisson is usually known for being evoked by experiences with music, the phenomenon can additionally be triggered with poetry, videos, beauty in nature or art, eloquent speeches, and the practice of science (mainly physics and mathematics).

The two bits I’ve bolded: Violating expectations and the practice of science, are what I want to cover in today’s post.

Much like with my opinions on Buddhism, I have problems with how modern science is portrayed. And not only science, but our notions of truth: What it is, how we arrive at it, and a fun little thing called

Memetics

Who doesn't love a good meme?

Nobody.

That's right. Even if you don't like cat pictures or poorly cropped text on a grainy JPEG, you love memes. Memes are not just pictures, they're "self-propagating units of cultural evolution". That is, everything about you that isn't a gene, is a meme. Which hopefully gives you some permission to take things less seriously.

How about an example:

When asked if he’s hungry, my dad will respond with a question: “What time is it?” And if it’s not at least noon, he’s not hungry.

Because it’s not lunchtime yet… obviously??

There are a few pieces at play here:

The hunger “gene”: Biological factors that make us feel hungry

The hunger perception: Actual feeling of our tummy doing a rumble

The hunger “meme”: Our ideas around hunger and how to respond to it

For non-insane people, the perception is primary, and the meme entails a logical response: “I feel hungry, thus it is time to put some food in my mouth.”

In my dad’s mind, the perception is secondary, and subservient to the meme: “If it is time to put food in my mouth, then hunger is warranted.”

I hope that sounds insane to everyone else reading this. Because… I think most of us treat science like my dad treats eating. As in: We believe more in the ideas we have about science rather than what the world is actually showing us.

Science

In the 17th century, a man by the name of René Descartes said "I think, therefore I am". And thus science was created.

Maybe some more stuff happened around the time of the Enlightenment that shifted the societal locus of control of Truth from religion and the church to rationalism and empiricism, but that's besides the point.

Descartes wanted a rational foundation for truth that could be certain. And thus rationalism was born: An epistemological view "in which the criterion of truth is not sensory but intellectual and deductive."

Sounds great! Has been great, even. For example, I would most definitely not be alive right now if not for many people appealing to reason instead of the gods for the last 400 years. And I like to think that's a good thing.

So why bring this all up?

Well, I have some questions. What have we defined as science, why have we decided that that definition is the truth (and defines truth), and most importantly: Is that definition limiting us?

Truth

The modern/popular definition of scientific truth, as I understand it, is more or less this: That which exists objectively, independent of any observer.

So things like math, physics, and chemistry, are true. Truth starts getting a little wavy around biology, and by the time we get to psychology and sociology it's kind of a mess. Still, if we're assuming the world is fully deterministic, it kind of makes sense that this would be the case. The more variables we have to factor in, the less accurate we can be with our predictions (and thus what we consider truth to be).

So to be a little bit more clear, I’d say the modern/rational definitions of science and truth could be summed up as follows:

Science is the practice of coming to conclusions about objective reality via replicable experiments that are [as] free [as possible] from bias

Truth is the predictive power we assign to a conclusion we've come to by performing science. The more confident we are in our conclusion, the more true that conclusion is.

So for example: By dropping various objects and measuring their acceleration, we've gotten pretty confident about gravity. Therefore we could say that it's "true" that gravity causes objects to fall.

Hopefully this all sounds fine so far. Because now it's time to take this train off the rails.

Descartes, to the Ring!

A couple more quick definitions:

Rationalism: Truth is "intellectual and deductive", purely based on reason (and not experience)

Empiricism: Truth is based purely on experience (and any "reason" is just another experience)

Descartes was a rationalist, but science is technically based on both, because:

The only way to perform experiments is to perform and experience them through your senses (empiricism)

The only way to come to scientific conclusions is by reasoning through your experience (rationalism)

You could argue semantics, but the point of this post is definitely not to argue about epistemology (It's actually to argue about ontology hehe) so I'll leave it at that.

But, speaking of ontology, I'm going to poke and prod at Descartes a bit here.

Certainty

First: Descartes wanted a foundation for truth that could be certain. And what's uncertain? Humans.

Thus, a science that discarded as many human biases as possible was born. Good, right? No pesky biases getting in the way of our studies.

And it has been good! A few unavoidable biases remain though.

Science still depends on sensory input: Sight. Technically, things like smell/taste/touch can be used to verify experiments (like chemical reactions), but where possible we've created instruments that allow us to verify everything by sight.

The only way we really have to "replicate" findings is to do the same experiment a bunch. We have randomization and control groups and large sample sizes and such to address this, and they work pretty well! Lots of variables to account for though.

The only way to declare something as a "truth" is to get other people to agree that it's a truth. Even if you do a great job removing bias with steps 1 and 2, if you don't convince other people of your conclusions well enough, you're out of luck and your finding isn't true.

Wait wait wait.

The finding is still true, it's just that other people don't know it is.

Right?

Objectivity

The fundamental claim Descartes, and modern science as a whole, rests on, is that there is an objective reality outside of our experience that is certain, and can be ascertained to some degree.

That claim has not been verified. That claim, the claim that the last 400 years of western scientific progress rests upon, is an assumption. And gradually, as science has continuously proven itself to be one of the most helpful human endeavors of all time, that assumption, hiding discreetly under science’s left wing, has stealthily shed its status as an assumption, and began to don the cloak of Truth.

But no more! I shine a flashlight upon thee, "objectivity"! And what's underneath, when the hood of that cloak flips up?

Memetics

What is this "objective reality" you speak of?

You say it exists. Nobody has ever seen it, and by your own admission, nobody ever can see it. We see subjective reality, but trust me, objective reality is right outside my eyes and I mostly see it accurately, except when science says I don't.

Objective reality definitely exists because it still exists even when I'm not conscious of it. Don't worry about the last 100 years of modern physics, which show very clearly that the physical properties of particles depends on their being observed, and that quantum entanglement means that particles can affect each other at speeds faster than light, and that the moon isn't there unless you're looking at it.

Time is definitely real, and it definitely just "started" with the big bang, and it will "end" (?) one day at the heat death of the universe, at which point it might "reset" (?) or maybe just go on forever I guess.

And matter? 100% real. I can feel the table, so it must be real. Those atoms, which, if particles, are 99.9999999% empty space, are definitely particles, and not actually just series of electron clouds. And those electron clouds? Definitely not reducible to probabilistic math, which is actually just an abstract tautological concept appearing as a perception in consciousness. And Niels Bohr sure didn't say that "everything we call real is made of things that cannot be regarded as real".

…

I think I'm done. For now.

Why did I title this section "memetics" if it's actually just me frothing at the mouth about objective reality?

My goal (maybe surprisingly) isn't actually to convince anyone that objective reality isn't real, and that we only live in a world created by our own consciousness or something. I don't know what reality is, and that's the point. My goal is just to demonstrate how much of a baseless assumption the "objective reality" claim is, and to free science from its shackles.

What would happen if we could also perform science that wasn't restricted by a necessarily objective, emotionless reality?

Very cool things, that's what.

Which is why it's high time to talk about memetics.

Memes - Truth’s Referent

All of the possible ideas we have come out of the boiling pot of our lives: Our genes, our experiences, and maybe the god(s) (if you're into that kind of thing). And those ideas, or memes, propagate, shaping the lives of everyone around us.

If we take a step back and really pay attention to the fact that every possible thing we know that isn't:

Genetic

Directly experienced

Or maybe gifted to us by divine grace

Is a meme... suddenly the concept of truth becomes a bit more malleable.

Remember the bit about needing to convince people of your experiment's validity for it to be considered "true"? That's because "truth" itself is not an objective thing. It's nice to believe that it's actually pointing at the referent we intuitively think it's pointing at (an objective reality), but if we actually dereference it, it turns out "truth" is just a meme that indicates how ontologically valid (real) we consider something to be.

We defined truth as "the predictive power we assign to a conclusion we've come to by performing science." Historically, we've only been allowed to apply this definition to experiments whose results fell under the doctrine of an objective, independent reality.

I've already made my argument for why it's sensible to drop the assumption that there must be an objective reality when it comes to doing science. But what kind of science can we perform instead? And what kind of possibilities does that open up for us as humans?

Do I have ideas about that? Of course I do.

What are they? Next time, perhaps.

Stay sharp, and happy trails!
