# Science, Memetics, and Truth

- Eating time, concepts

Everything is shaped by narrative. _Is_ everything narrative?

___

Obviously not. A table isn't a narrative. It's a real, physical object, made of real, physical particles. Alright, I give up, everything we believe the world to be must be real.

But wait.

If we believe the world to be made out of physical particles, that in itself is a narrative. And if we believe we're picking a glass up off of the table, that's a narrative too. Does that mean that what is real is the narrative?

Again, obviously not. The table is the real thing, the narrative is just what's in our heads.

Do I sound insane right now? Maybe I am.

What is insane? What is truth? What is real?

I look to science for answers.

## Science

In the 15th century, a man by the name of Ren√© Descartes said "I think, therefore I am". And thus science was created.

Maybe some more stuff happened around the Enlightenment that shifted the societal locus of control of Truth from religion and the church to rationalism and empiricism, but that's beside the point.

Descartes wanted a rational foundation for truth that could be certain. And thus rationalism was born: An epistemological view "in which the criterion of truth is not sensory but intellectual and deductive."

Sounds great! Has been great, even. For example, I would most definitely not be alive right now if not for the world at large appealing to reason instead of the gods for the last 400 years. And I like to think that's a good thing.

So why bring this all up?

Well, I have some questions. What have we defined as science, _why_ have we decided that that definition is the truth (and defines truth), and is that definition limiting us?

## Truth

The modern/popular definition of scientific truth, as I understand it, is more or less this: That which exists objectively, independent of any observer. So things like math, physics, and chemistry. Truth starts getting a little wavy around biology, and by the time we get to psychology and sociology it's just a mess. Still, if we're assuming the world is fully deterministic, it kind of makes sense that this would be the case. The more variables we have to factor in, the less accurate we can be with our predictions (and thus what we consider truth to be).

So to be a little bit more clear:

- Science is the practice of coming to conclusions about objective reality via replicable experiments that are [as] free [as possible] from bias
- Truth is the predictive power we assign to a conclusion we've come to by performing science. The more confident we are in our conclusion, the more "truth" that conclusion is.

So by dropping various objects and measuring their acceleration, we're pretty confident about gravity. Therefore we could say that it's "true" that gravity causes objects to fall.

Hopefully this all sounds fine so far. Because now it's time to take this train off the rails.

### Descartes, to the Ring!

Quick definitions:

- Rationalism: Truth is "intellectual and deductive", purely based on reason (and not experience)
- Empiricism: Truth is based purely on experience (and any "reason" is just another experience)

Descartes was a rationalist, but science is technically based on both:

- The only way to perform experiments is to experience them through your senses
- The only way to come to scientific conclusions is by reasoning through your experience

You could argue semantics, but the point of this post is definitely not to argue about epistemology (It's actually to argue about ontology hehe) so I'll leave it at that.

But, speaking of ontology, I'm going to poke and prod at Descartes a bit here.

#### Certainty

First: Descartes wanted a foundation for truth that could be certain. What's uncertain? Humans.

And thus, a science that discarded as many human biases as possible was born. Good, right? No pesky biases getting in the way of our studies.

And it has been good! A few unavoidable biases remain though.

- Science still depends on sensory input: Sight. Technically, things like smell/taste/touch can be used to verify experiments (like chemical reactions), but where possible we've created instruments that allow us to verify everything by sight.
- The only way we really have to "replicate" findings is to do the same experiment a bunch. We have randomization and control groups and large sample sizes and such to address this, and they work pretty well! Lots of variables to account for though.
- The only way to declare something as a "truth" is to get other people to agree that it's a truth. Even if you do great at removing bias with steps 1 and 2, if you don't convince other people well enough, you're out of luck and your finding isn't true.

Wait wait wait. The finding is still _true_, it's just that other poeple don't know it is.

Right?

#### Objectivity

The fundamental claim Descartes, and modern science as a whole, rests on, is that there _is_ an objective reality outside of our experience that _is_ certain, and can be ascertained to some degree.

That claim has not been verified. That claim, that the last 400 years of western scientific progress has been built upon, is an assumption. And gradually, as science has proven itself to be one of the most helpful human endeavors of all time: That assumption, hiding discreetly under the guise of "science", has shed its status as an assumption, and donned the cloak of Truth.

But no more! I shine a flashlight upon thee, "objectivity"! And what's there, when the hood of the cloak is flipped?

## Memetics

What is this "objective reality" you speak of?

You say it exists. Nobody has ever seen it, and by your own admisison, nobody ever _can_ see it. We see subjective reality, but trust me, objective reality is right outside my eyes and I mostly see it accurately, except when science says I don't.

Objective reality definitely exists because it still exists even when I'm not conscious of it. Don't worry about the last 100 years of modern physics, which show very clearly that the physical existence of particles depends on their being observed, and that quantum entanglement means that particles can affect each other at speeds faster than light, and that [the moon isn't there unless you're looking at it](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-universe-is-not-locally-real-and-the-physics-nobel-prize-winners-proved-it/).

Time is definitely real, and it definitely just "started" with the big bang, and it will "end" (?) one day at the heat death of the universe, which will "restart" (?) or maybe just go on forever I guess.

And matter? 100% real. I can feel the table, so it must be real. Those atoms, which, if particles, are 99.9999999% empty space, are definitely particles, and not actually just [series of electron clouds](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2020/04/16/you-are-not-mostly-empty-space/?sh=4dd79f722c2b). And those electron clouds? Definitely not reducible to probibalistic math, which is actually just an abstract concept appearing as a perception in consciousness. And Niels Bohr sure didn't [say](https://www.livescience.com/32016-niels-bohr-atomic-theory.html) that "everything we call real is made of things that cannot be regarded as real".

...

I think I'm done. For now.

Why did I title this section "memetics" if it's actually just me frothing at the mouth about objective reality?

My goal (maybe surprisingly) isn't actually to convince anyone that objective reality isn't real, and that we only live in a world created by our own consciousness or something. I don't _know_ what reality is, and that's the point. My goal is just to demonstrate how much of a baseless assumption the "objective reality" claim is, and to free science from its shackles.

What would happen if we could perform science that _wasn't_ restricted by a necessarily objective, emotionless reality?

Very cool things, that's what.

Which is why it's high time to talk about memetics.

### What is a Meme?

Who doesn't love a good meme?

_Nobody_.

That's right. Even if you don't like cat pictures or poorly cropped text, you love memes. Memes are not just pictures, they're "self-propagating units of cultural evolution". That is, everything about you that _isn't_ a gene, is a meme. Which hopefully gives you some permission to take things less seriously.

But more importantly, we are informational transformers, and our outputs are memes. All of the possible ideas we have come out of the boiling pot of our lives: Our genes, our experiences, and maybe the god(s) (if you're into that kind of thing). And those ideas, or memes, propagate, shaping the lives of everyone around us.

If we take a step back and really pay attention to the fact that every possible thing we know that isn't:

- Genetic
- Directly experienced
- Gifted to us by divine grace

Is a _meme_... suddenly the concept of truth becomes a bit more malleable.

Remember the bit about needing to convince people of your experiment's validity for it to be considered "true"? That's because "truth" itself is not an objective thing. It's nice to believe that it's actually pointing at the referent we intuitively think it's pointing at (an objective reality), but if we actually dereference it, it turns out "truth" is just a meme that indicates how ontologically valid (real) we consider something to be.

We defined truth as "the predictive power we assign to a conclusion we've come to by performing science." Historically, we've only been allowed to apply this definition to experiments whose results fell under the doctrine of an objective, independent reality.

I've already made my argument for why it's sensible to drop the assumption that there _must_ be an objective reality when it comes to doing science. But what kind of science can we perform instead? And what kind of possibilities does that open up for us as humans?

Do I have ideas about that? Of course I do. What are they? Next time, perhaps.

Stay sharp, and happy trails!
