## One Thinky Boi

When I was younger, I always liked mazes. I particularly liked the challenge of not drawing any lines until I had them completely solved. Now, I'm slowly realizing that solving everything in my head probably had some unintended consequences _beyond_ just math teachers complaining that I never showed my work.

Looking back, thinking has always been my happy place. School quickly installed me with the "intelligence = self-worth" wiring, and at the same time, I started realizing that sharing feelings was dangerous: Uncurated thoughts could make people react poorly, and being the one responsible for making someone else feel bad was inconceivable. Clearly it was much better to just think of the optimal response and say that.

So it didn't really matter that I never got close with anyone new in middle school, and that I never went out of my way to spend time with new people in high school... or in college. I still saw my old friends, and anyway, getting a good job was priority #1. In the meantime, digging into a creative problem was like cocaine for my little nerd brain. Every solution was a fresh hit: "YES. I'm smart. This is what it's all about."

But sometime around 2016, during college (coincidentally around the time I was forced to start making my own life decisions), my mind raised a problem of a new kind:

"What is the meaning of life?"

The question itself is almost laughable. But why? Its ubiquity? The unspoken agreement that it's unsolvable? The implicit assumption that meaning isn't real? The otherwise intolerable tension of existential dread? Or maybe... because of all of those reasons and more, to even ask the question is to be unwell.

At the time, I didn't give a second thought as to why I had the question, or if it even had a definitive answer. To me, if it had a question mark, it was solvable. And I was a guy who could solve things. I had never been concerned about meaning or existence before, but now I suddenly was. However, my brain rationalized it nicely:

"If I have to start deciding how I want to live my life, I obviously have to make the right decisions. And if I don't know what's actually meaningful, how can I know which decisions are the right ones?"

The question pittered around in the back of my head for a couple of years as I worked my way through college, and I eventually settled on an answer that suited me just fine: "The meaning of life is to find a meaning in life". I don't recall actually landing on a specific meaning for myself at the time, but satisfaction at my own recursive prowess kept me placated.

Thinking wins again.

## Problem Town, USA

2020 arrived. I had landed a good software engineering job, and things were going pretty alright. I wasn't seeing my friends as often as I had in college, but at least I was seeing coworkers at the office and regulars at the gym. Then Covid hit.

Suddenly, I was utterly isolated: Working from home, exercising alone at my apartment's gym, and filling in any free time with video games. Sensing the interpersonal void growing inside, I resorted to the dating apps. As usual, and without awareness of what I was doing, I applied my normal strategy: Be myself, but only on the condition that speaking honest feelings is not allowed. After about 6 months of continuous isolation and self-sabotage, I happened to flex my psoas (AKA the "fear" muscle) in a way it really didn't enjoy. Suddenly I couldn't feeling anything from sex.

As any 20-something male would do, I tried to fix the problem by any means necessary:

Physical therapy, doctors, X-rays, MRIs...

Acupuncture, yoga, chiropractors...

Trying...

Waiting...

Losing hope,

Running out of reasons to live.

Neither my abilities nor the abilities of the specialists I went to were up to the task. And so, the great question of the the condition of my existence again reared its head: this time with extra nihilism.

Finding some transient meaning wasn't enough now. What was _actually_ real? What could I rely upon when both my physical and cognitive abilities were failing in the present, and the future of my current trajectory was no better?

Coincidentally, a friend had recently introduced me to Waking Up: A meditation app advertising a deeper examination of life. And so, once again I found my refuge in thinking: this time by investigating the nature of my own experience.

After all, I was a guy who could solve things. Why not reality itself?

## Solutionville?

The Waking Up app was cool; for the first time ever I got to hear people who seemed similarly interested in peeking below the surface of life. It was a whole new world for me, but even then, most of the app fell short of exactly what I was looking for. Practices and pointers were great, but I wanted _answers_, damnit.

After listening to the series on Stoicism, I had just about had it. I wrote down my review at the time: "Very solid coping mechanisms for nerds". I was so glad that the stoics had a way to cope with reality, but what actually _was_ reality?

Finally, I stumbled upon a section of the app called "The Path of Insight"; a series of Buddha Dharma talks by Joseph Goldstein. At first, it sounded like a bunch of religious dogma: "Be kind to thy neighbor" and whatnot. But as I continued hitting play, I started realizing something: "Wait, this is actually a science? Of subjective experience? And not only is it a science, but it's a _solved_ science? The Buddha just _has_ the answers, and it turns out those answers solve suffering for good?!?" I was still skeptical, but Buddhism seemed to be on an entirely different level of insight, practicality, and scientific rigor from anything else on the app.

## The Path of Fear

Buddhism is complex, heavy, and in a lot of ways, opposite of most people's conceptions of existence. Just hearing about it can strike people in unexpected ways. So consider this a disclaimer: **Buddhism warning: Potentially distressing ontology ahead.**

There's a phenomenon that sometimes occurs when somebody's closest loved ones pass away. For a few weeks or months, they suddenly get interested in Buddhism, and as the pain fades, so too does the interest. In the face of inconsolable grief, people are forced to face their suffering directly, for a time, their perspective on life matches the Buddha's.

If you aren't familiar with Buddhism already, it's basically this: Life inherently has suffering in it, being free from suffering is _the_ most important possible thing (implicit), therefore we should transcend life. By investigating your own experience, you can see exactly how suffering originates and cut it off at its root.

For me, I was already quite interested in understanding reality (for reasons mentioned above). I was already on the path to finding Buddhism, so all I needed was a little boost of suffering to push me off the diving board and into the deep end.

## 123 Problem Street, Problem Town, USA

One of the characteristics of existence (according to the Buddha) is "dukkha", which more or less means "suffering". In any moment of perception, the Buddha says that there is some amount of suffering, and the way to get clear on that is to meditate on it.

Turns out, if you practice viewing all phenomena as suffering while under paranoia-inducing substances, it's possible to convince your brain that it is "The Truth" (superseding all other truths). And from firsthand experience, I can tell you that the effects of that (with 0 other preparation) are not good. The last few months of 2022 were by far the most miserable I've had in my entire life.

Specifically, what happened for me was a sudden jolt of realization that everything was a trick. All good things, all bad things, every thing that _has_ happened or _will_ happen was just fake, and caring about any of it could only lead to suffering. You know how your brain will drift off into daydreams as soon as you're not focusing on something? Well every time that happened, instead of random thoughts about myself or others or the future or the past, it was just "this is all suffering". The only thing that helped was to clear my mind by meditating, but usually the thought of being alone with my own mind was too overwhelmingly terrifying to allow myself to do even that. For a few weeks after my initial jolt, I could not go to sleep without a light on and some audio playing to try to distract my mind from "The Truth".

One of the worst parts of my mental shift had been that it felt dangerous to even talk to other people about it: If I had gotten myself into this state, I had to avoid getting anyone else into it at all costs. The second worst part was that Buddhism is unfalsifiable. So any thoughts along the lines of "just believe something different" didn't penetrate my self-imposed sphere of suffering.

There were only two things that really pulled me out of it: Time, and Rob Burbea.

## Rob Burbea

I don't think I can possibly introduce Rob Burbea in a way that does him justice. He's just the man.

But for starters: Rob was the resident teacher at Gaia House in England, teaching Buddhist insight meditation (and much, much more) from 2005 to 2015. In 2020, he passed away due to pancreatic cancer, but during the last 5 years of his life he worked tirelessly from home to continue his work.

For the purposes of this post, I won't talk about Rob for too long, so if you want a fully-fledged introduction of Rob, his teachings, and the positive impact he's had on many people's lives, I highly recommend [This wonderful article from Tasshin](https://tasshin.com/blog/rob-burbea-ordinary-guy-werewolf-eternal-wanderer/).

But to get a feel for the type of person Rob was, these two quotes (pulled from Tasshin's article) do a good job of it:

> "... This playfulness with ways of looking and conceptual frameworks, an ability to play with and to entertain ideas, metaphysical ideas, even, without holding them and believing in them as true, or â€˜this is reality,â€™ or whatever."

> "If we talk about self-images and the way self can be imaged, I could say, speaking a soul-truth if you like, from a soul perspective, I could say, â€˜I am,â€™ in inverted commas: â€˜I am a lover. I am a mystic. I am a scholar. I am a preacher. Iâ€™m a theoretical physicist. I am a political revolutionary. I am a wild sexual beast who is definitely not monogamous. I am a researcher into consciousness. I am a jazz musician. Iâ€™m a crazy poet. Iâ€™m a serious composer. Iâ€™m just an ordinary guy. Iâ€™m a teacher. Iâ€™m a student. Iâ€™m a monk. Iâ€™m a clown. Iâ€™m a vampire. Iâ€™m a wild man. Iâ€™m a werewolf. Iâ€™m a healer and a shaman. Iâ€™m some kind of fugitive, some eternal wanderer, outcast. Iâ€™m the tramp on the outskirts of town. Iâ€™m a lone soldier in a forever war.â€™
>
> Some of those I am or have been in my life conventionally. Some conventionally. All of them mythically. None of them really."

Rob brought a sense of magic to life that, combined with his intellectual rigor and deep dedication to action, introduced many people (myself included) to an entirely different way of seeing and living life.

At the time of my crisis, Rob's talks were like a lifeline thrown to a man drowning at sea: He had seen Buddhism, walked the path himself, and gone beyond it. And things were okay.

"War and courage have done more great things than charity. Not your sympathy, but your bravery hath hitherto saved the victims." - Friedrich Nietzsche, _Thus Spoke Zarathustra_ [1]


Nietzsche[2]:

The higher itâ€™s type, always the seldomer doth a thing succeed. Ye higher men here, have ye not all - been failures? Be of good cheer; what doth it matter? How much is still possible! Learn to laugh at yourselves, as ye ought to laugh!

What wonder even that ye have failed and only half-succeeded, ye half-shattered ones! Doth not - manâ€™s future strive and struggle in you? Manâ€™s furthest, profoundest, star- highest issues, his prodigious powers - do not all these foam through one another in your vessel? What wonder that many a vessel shattereth! Learn to laugh at yourselves, as ye ought to laugh! Ye higher men, oh, how much is still possible! 

And verily, how much hath already succeeded! How rich is this earth in small, good, perfect things, in well-constituted things! Set around you small, good, perfect things, ye higher men. Their golden maturity healeth the heart. The perfect teacheth one to hope.
