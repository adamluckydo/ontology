## Buddhism Debate

Buddhism is heavy stuff.

Not only is it complex, and incredibly far out of the realm of our normal conception of existence, but even just hearing about it can strike people in unexpected ways. Furthermore, attempting to follow its doctrines it in earnest can be mentally destabilizing (even when practice is going "well").

### The Middle Way

Emptiness: the word itself has immensely nihilistic connotations, but the Buddha explicitly condemned nihilism as a philosophical stance.

In a very real sense, the Buddhist path is based on a sense of fear.

### Is Buddhism the Truth?

Is it possible for a human being to have _the_ Truth? 

### Will awakening cause you to lose your personality?

No, you will pretty much be unidentifiably different from before. I say this based on:

- Experience direclty interacting with awakened people
- Hearing accounts from awakened people
- Understanding the process of awakening itself at a general level

Nothing about meditation "removes" any part of your personality, but it may make you a bit more awkward if you spend all of your time meditating without socializing.

### Is the work required to reach stream entry worth it?

Who do you believe? If you believe your unawakened self, then almost definitely no. But I'd advise you to consider Plato's [Allegory of the Cave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69F7GhASOdM).

If you listen to any stream enterer, almost all will say that the shift that occurs was the most important event of their lives, bar none. And most will spend the rest of their lives trying to help other people experience the same.

Whether you personally should make the effort can only be a personal decision. Do you desire to try? And speaking of desire...

### Does the Buddha hate desire?

If you read the Four Noble Truths, it's pretty easy to draw the conclusion that desire is the root of all suffering. Therefore, the Buddha must think desire is bad.

Well, turns out, the Buddha also coined a listicle called "The Four Bases of Power". They are:

1. Desire
2. Effort
3. Focus
4. Inquiry

The Buddha noted these qualities specifically with respect to making progress on the path. Meaning: To free yourself from desire, you need desire. But if you look at that list again, those are qualities required to make progress in _anything_.

So if you don't actually have the desire to follow the Buddha's path, you won't really want to put the effort in, your focus in meditation will be poor, and you won't be curious enough to investigate your experience enough to actually reach any sort of awakening.

This is why it's important to ask...

### What is your actual desire?

If Buddhism appeals to you, I think it's important to deeply inquire into why. And that's not coming from a place of judgement, but a place of practicality. If you do not deeply desire the reason you're actually practicing, you not only won't likely get anywhere, but you may end up in a mental state far worse than you began with.

Here are some reasons I can think people would want to engage directly with Buddhist teachings:

- Something about the teachings is true and beautiful to them; something deep within them loves the Dharma
- They are deeply suffering
- They have a background in religion/spirituality/meditation that doesn't see the claims as antithetical to their current ontology
- They have reached the point in their lives where selflessness has naturally overtaken self-interest as their primary motivator
- They are willing to risk it all to understand the nature of reality (me)

If you don't fall into any of these camps, then what?

### What actually feels good?

- Trying my absolute hardest
- Believing in something
- Feeling connected with other people
- Absurd, goofy, and creative things that are nonetheless impactful
- Adrenaline rushes from running while listening to music
- Working through a complex issue


### What is most important?

- Paying attention to where your attention is, and directing it towards the things you want to see more of

### What are the ingredients of success?
