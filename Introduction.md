# Introduction

When I was younger, I always liked mazes. I particularly liked the challenge of not drawing any lines until I had them completely solved. Now, I'm slowly realizing that solving everything in my head probably had some unintended consequences _beyond_ just math teachers complaining that I never showed my work.

Looking back, thinking has always been my happy place. In school, being smart was rewarded with praise and good grades, installing the wiring in my head that said "intelligence = self-worth". And at the same time, I started realizing that sharing feelings was dangerous: Uncurated thoughts could make people react poorly, and being the one responsible for making someone else feel bad was inconceivable. Clearly it was much better to just think of the optimal response and say that.

So it didn't really matter that I never got close with anyone new in middle school, and that I never went out of my way to spend time with new people in high school... or in college. I still saw my old friends, and anyway, getting a good job was priority #1. In the meantime, digging into a creative problem was like cocaine for my little nerd brain. Every solution was a fresh hit: "YES. I'm smart. This is what it's all about."

But sometime around 2016, during college (coincidentally around the time I was forced to start making my own life decisions), my mind raised a problem of a new kind:

"What is the meaning of life?"

The question itself is almost laughable. But why? Its ubiquity? The unspoken agreement that it's unsolvable? The implicit assumption that meaning isn't real? The otherwise intolerable tension of existential dread? Or maybe... because of all of those reasons and more, even asking the question is an admission of being unwell.

At the time, I didn't give a second thought as to why I had the question, or even if it had a definitive answer. To me, if it had a question mark, it was solvable. And I was a guy who could solve things. I had never been concerned about meaning or existence before, but now I suddenly was. However, my brain rationalized it nicely:

"If I have to start deciding how I want to live my life, I obviously have to make the right decisions. And if I don't know what's actually meaningful, how can I know which decisions are the right ones?"

The question pittered around in the back of my head for a couple of years as I worked my way through college, and I eventually settled on an answer that suited me just fine: "The meaning of life is to find a meaning in life". I don't recall actually landing on a specific meaning for myself at the time, but satisfaction at my own recursive prowess kept me placated.

Thinking wins again.

2020 arrived. I had landed a good software engineering job, and things were going pretty alright. I wasn't seeing my friends as often as I had in college, but at least I was seeing coworkers at the office and regulars at the gym. Then Covid hit.

Suddenly, I was utterly isolated: Working from home, exercising alone at my apartment's gym, and filling in any free time with video games. Sensing the interpersonal void growing inside, I resorted to the dating apps. As usual, and without awareness of what I was doing, I applied my normal strategy: Be myself, but only on the condition that speaking honest feelings is not allowed. After about 6 months of continuous isolation and self-sabotage, I experienced a freak injury in my psoas that made sitting painful and prevented me from feeling anything from sex. I was at peak misery.

As usual, the solution was surely to solve this dilemma with my most powerful weapon: Thinking. Out of embarassment, I tried waiting my condition out, but time dragged on with no noticeable change. Finally, I went to the doctor. I got an X-Ray and an MRI: Nothing. I tried physical therapy, and that helped marginally with the pain, but not with the more debilitating issue. I tried alternative approaches: Acupuncture, yoga, chiropractors -- nada. Neither my abilities nor the abilities of the specialists I went to were up to the task. And so, the great question of the the condition of my existence again reared its head: this time with extra nihilism.

Finding some transient meaning wasn't enough now. What was _actually_ real? What could I rely upon when both my physical and cognitive abilities were failing in the present, and the future of my current trajectory was no better?

Coincidentally, a friend had recently introduced me to Waking Up: a meditation app offering to help its users more deeply examine life. And so, once again I found my refuge in thinking: this time by investigating the nature of my own experience.

After all, I was a guy who could solve things. Why not reality itself?

The Waking Up app was cool; for the first time ever I got to hear people who seemed similarly interested in peeking below the surface of life. It was a whole new world for me, but even then, most teachings fell short of exactly what I was looking for. Practices and pointers were great, but I wanted _answers_, damnit.

After listening to the series on Stoicism, I had just about had it. I wrote down my review at the time: "Very solid coping mechanisms for nerds". I was so glad that the stoics had a way to cope with reality, but what actually _was_ reality?

Finally, I stumbled upon a section of the app called "The Path of Insight"; a series of Buddha Dharma talks by Joseph Goldstein. At first, it sounded like a bunch of religious dogma: "Be kind to thy neighbor" and whatnot. But as I continued hitting play, I started realizing something: "Wait, this is actually a science? Of subjective experience? And not only is it a science, but it's a _solved_ science? The Buddha just _has_ the answers, and it turns out those answers solve suffering for good?!?" I was still skeptical, but Buddhism seemed to be on an entirely different level of insight, practicality, and scientific rigor from anything else on the app.

Over the course of the next three years (we are now at the present date): I read an absolute truckload of opinions from meditators on Twitter, meditated a decent amount myself, accidentally threw my psyche into a state of immense suffering lasting for 3 months, discovered Rob Burbea (<3), recovered mentally, pieced together a coherent picture of the Buddha's teachings, and worked to reconcile them with my own life experience.

I haven't solved reality (yet), and I also haven't solved my health problems OR gained the ability to feel things naturally in the presence of other people, but I'm making progress.

In the meantime, and as part of my ongoing work, I want to document the things I've found to be most important and/or are underdiscussed elsewhere. Hopefully it shapes up to be an interesting read, and if it's helpful to anyone, even better.

I was originally planning on just making one post, but due to length it's going to end up being three (or four if you count this one). So more of a mini-series.

And in this series, I'm going to cover:

1. A straightforward explanation of the Buddha's most central realizations and existential stance in fully English terms.
2. How Buddhism has affected me personally, and a series of questions discussing the practicality of practicing it.
3. How I currently relate to Buddhism, desire, ontology (beliefs about what is real), and life as a whole.

I'll be releasing one part per week, so if you're interested, stay tuned for an adventure! `:)`
