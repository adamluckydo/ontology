# On Death And Dying

Today I've once again been moved to talk about Rob Burbea.

My favorite talk of his, [*Practising with Death and Dying*](https://hermesamara.org/resources/talk/2020-02-20-practising-with-death-and-dying), is not really about death. It is, but it's much more about life.

I think I've thought about death incorrectly for my entire life. It was always this vague thing that must just be "too painful to wrap my head around", so I was failing in some way by either not being eternally afraid of it, or because I simply didn't understand what it really meant.

Coming up, May 7th will be the 4th anniversary of Rob's death. I never knew him, and I think it was meant to be that way. The image of a person can never be matched by their physical incarnation, and Rob's image for me has been the single most powerful force shaping my life over the past few years. Turns out, if you direct autism in the direction of the sacred, powerful things start happening.

And what I'd like to talk about today is why that's a good thing.

## The Big Four

In his talk, Rob lists four things that he felt "opens out the whole sense of death, and brings a level of beauty and peace there".

This piece is very hard to write, since even using words like "beauty" with respect to the topic of death needs to be done with immense care and intention. I trust everyone reading this will respect the topic likewise.

Rob's list of four is as follows (and I'll include my commentary on what each of them mean to me alongside them; if you want his take you can listen to the talk):

### 1 - Emptiness Practice and Understanding

For anyone not familiar with the Dharma, this one is tricky. If you stretch your sense of what it means that we exist, and then stretch it further than that, and then flip that stretched sense inside out so it's covering even the idea that we exist at all... maybe you can glimpse it. Or you can do 10,000 hours of meditation practice :)

To me, "emptiness" utterly fails to convey the absolute, astounding, jaw-dropping, world-shaking sense of enormity that even my current grasp of the concept entails.

For a second, throw aside any notions you have about how reality works, why we exist, who we are, the whole lot.

First: There is something instead of nothing. We are experiencing this universe, and by all "logical" accounts, the most likely thing seems like it should be that nothing exists, and therefore there is no force that can exist to create something out of nothing. But here we are. There is something (ostensibly), and not only that, but we are one and the same as that something.

Second: How long has that something been happening? If you count the time before and after your existence, that is either the length of the universe (but we're throwing out previous ideas about how things work right now) or infinity. Or... not at all? This is where the mind-stretching comes into play.

Third: This very moment, and the next, and the next, are all *THAT*. The universe is whistling to itself in the kitchen, and we are the tune. Every moment of everything *is* everything.

### 2 - Gift, Given and Received

Until just about now, I used to think there was something wrong with me (seems to be a trend). In this case, the fact that I didn't have the ability to make myself happy. I could play video games, and eat tasty food, and do anything else I liked to spend time on on my own, but I only recently realized that those things didn't bring happiness exactly — they brought a combination of two other, more nuanced, feelings: Satisfaction, and yearning.

Satisfaction: At risk of getting into shark-infested Buddhist waters, doing pleasurable things has a history of giving me a feeling of satisfaction. Sue me. If I do enough satisfying things in a day for myself, I feel alright when I go to bed.

Yearning, in both the micro and the macro: I yearn.

Doing satisfying things for myself is satisfying, but I can't ignore the fact that most of the experiences are actually composed of yearning. Wanting the next upgrade, wanting the next tasty bite, wanting something to be over with.

What doesn't feel like yearning is genuine interaction with other people. The best moments of my life, and the ones I will cherish forever, all involve other people. In that sense, the "gift" is of course not literal. Simply by existing, and interacting with other people, you are engaging in an infinite exchange of gifts. And in a way (and this lesson has been brutal for me to learn), by not giving people access to your truest self, you're staunching the flow of gifts. Santa won't be very happy with you for that one.

### 3 - Doing, and Having Done, One's Duty

Do you feel like you have a duty in this life?

I think it's fine to sit with that question for a while, and whatever answer you come up with is probably the right one.

Even accepting the question as a valid one brings with it a slough of metaphysical assumptions, so it's understandable if it's not tenable to even contemplate. But I would ask: Where did the idea that you can't ask questions come from?

For myself (and this was similar for Rob), this is less of a sense of "I know *exactly* what I am here to do and I am doing it", and more of an endless series of moments in which I feel called to act on. Where does that call come from? For me, it's typically Rob's image. Which of course, is an appearance in my mind. And the ontological status of image is zilch in modern society (sorry Plato). Does that make it less worthwhile? And furthermore, would that make the sense of duty, and having done one's best in this life, meangingless as well?

This is (once again) a tricky topic that I could devote more than an entire post to, but I want to at least make one thing clear: I am *not* saying that Rob's image is like a physical manifestation that is literally communicating with me in any real way. It's based on emptiness (outlined above). On a personal level, I do not believe in material reality as being "fundamental"; I believe in the universe whistling to itself, and materiality is an outshoot of that. *Therefore*, the image of Rob is no less a part of the universe's tune than the material form in which I am experiencing that image. Sorry if that doesn't make sense; it deserves so much more than a paragraph.

### 4 - Aspiring to Live a Really Worthwhile Life

I'll quote Rob here: "One has aspired towards the Good, with a capital G, towards what really matters, a sense of what really matters, and taken the trouble to find out what that is for oneself, and to get one's bearings, even in times of confusion and being inundated with other pushes and pulls, and indoctrinations, and advertisements, and peer pressure, and all kinds of things — risks and threats. That one has lived in that direction; one has tried to live as much as possible in that direction."

## The Scope of our Lives

In my experience, the four topics listed above — if engaged with and understood — are incredibly valuable. There's a reason that this is my favorite talk of Rob's.

But there's a reason I'm choosing today to write this post, and it's because of a bonus category that Rob mentioned after the previous four.

### Bonus - Soulmaking

From Rob: "There's the possibility of being so touched by a soulmaking experience, having an opening in imaginal practice or sensing with soul where one's profoundly moved by a sense of grace, a sense of eternality, a sense of participating in something so unfathomably beautiful and divine."

In the last part of the talk, Rob discusses his own impending death from pancreatic cancer, and what a close friend of his wrote in relation to it.

> "Can this become soulmaking?", he gently asked ['he' is me]... I do not know what this will look like as we face this time, or if I am up to the task. But I can see that the question itself offers a frame, a way to orient to the time ahead, whatever it may bring. ... can it be soulmaking? Yes, it can. I have some faith in that."  I am already much less in contention with the reality of the situation, and my loving desire is switched on again towards what I most love: Soulmaking.

> "I don't want you to die." And again, she really let herself feel it. Letting herself have this, "I don't want," loosened something. Really letting herself have this, "I don't want you to die" — it loosened something, without dissolving the "I don't want." Right? We can loosen things so that they dissolve, completely unfabricate, or we can loosen things enough, with a slight unfabricating, so that they actually can become more soulmaking. So it's like a cry out to the cosmos: "I don't want you to die. I don't want you to die."

> Then I got the sense that your death is eternal. It's always here. My friend's death is eternal — it's always here.

## Why I'm writing this

I lost the only person I've ever loved to suicide when I was in college. I've never known how to properly feel the weight of that. Do I just need to bawl my eyes out for hours? Maybe. But a part of me has always known, always sensed, that it's not just pain. There's something else there.

How can we relate to death without also relating to the whole universe? The sense of what we are, of what we're doing here, and of how it ends is all wrapped up together.

I love you Jane. Thank you.
