# Practical Practice

## What exactly _is_ the Buddhist Path?

Here's an excerpt from one of the talks Rob Burbea gave at a [2008 retreat](https://hermesamara.org/resources/talk/2008-12-28-the-meaning-of-refuge):

> One of my teachers, Ajaan Geoff, said the path is based on a sense of fear, which when I first heard it, I was like, "Wow, that's really odd." Actually to have a very alive sense of danger and fear, it's a requirement for refuge. So the Buddha would encourage these kind of reflections, reflections on ageing, reflections on the fact of sickness, reflections on death, reflections on loss, on the inevitable growing separate from what and who we love. This is the nature of things, and so he said one should reflect, "I am subject to ageing, subject to sickness, subject to death, subject to loss. I have not gone beyond ageing, sickness, death." To really reflect on this. And then to reflect further: "I am not the only one subject to ageing, sickness, death, etc. All beings are subject to ageing, have not gone beyond ageing, sickness, death, loss."

Not only is Buddhism complex, heavy, and incredibly far out of the realm of our normal conception of existence, but even just hearing about it can strike people in unexpected ways. Furthermore, attempting to follow its doctrines it in earnest can be mentally destabilizing (even when practice is going "well"). At least, that's what happened to me.

Turns out, if you meditate a bunch and practice viewing all phenomena as suffering, it's possible to convince your brain that it is the truth. And the effects of doing that (at the very least with no preparation) are not good.

Specifically, the way it registered for me was like a sudden jolt of realization that everything was a trick. All good things, all bad things, every thing that _has_ happened or _will_ happen was just fake, and caring about any of it could only lead to suffering. You know how your brain will drift off into daydreams as soon as you're not focusing on something? Well every time that happened, instead of random thoughts about myself or others or the future or the past, it was just "this is all suffering". And the only thing that helped was to clear my mind by meditating, but the thought of being alone with my own mind was too overwhelmingly terrifying to allow myself to do even that. For a few weeks after the initial shift, I could not go to sleep without a light on and some audio playing to try to distract my mind from "the truth".

There were only two things that really pulled me out of it: Time, and Rob Burbea.

## Who is Rob Burbea?

"What am I becoming as the days and nights fly past?"[1]

## Is Buddhism the Truth?

Is it possible for a human being to have _the_ Truth?

### Paradoxes

- Emptiness of all particles, what's fundamental? Time? Space?

### Provisional Truths

Einstein didn’t disprove Newtonian mechanics so much as identify it as a special case in a more general framework. Whatever future physics is, its first step will be to recreate the predictive power of the Standard Model

Einstein: “while general relativity might one day be superseded, the statistical theory of atoms will never be overthrown.”

## Will awakening cause you to lose your personality?

No, you will pretty much be unidentifiably different from before. I say this based on:

- Experience direclty interacting with awakened people
- Hearing accounts from awakened people
- Understanding the process of awakening itself at a general level

Nothing about meditation "removes" any part of your personality, but it may make you a bit more awkward if you spend all of your time meditating without socializing.

## Is the work required to reach stream entry worth it?

Who do you believe? If you believe your unawakened self, then almost definitely no. But I'd advise you to consider Plato's [Allegory of the Cave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69F7GhASOdM).

If you listen to any stream enterer, almost all will say that the shift that occurs was the most important event of their lives, bar none. And most will spend the rest of their lives trying to help other people experience the same.

Whether you personally should make the effort can only be a personal decision. Do you desire to try? And speaking of desire...

## Does the Buddha hate desire?

If you read the Four Noble Truths, it's pretty easy to draw the conclusion that desire is the root of all suffering. Therefore, the Buddha must think desire is bad.

Well, turns out, the Buddha also coined a listicle called "The Four Bases of Power". They are:

1. Desire
2. Effort
3. Focus
4. Inquiry

The Buddha noted these qualities specifically with respect to making progress on the path. Meaning: To free yourself from desire, you need desire. But if you look at that list again, those are qualities required to make progress in _anything_.

So if you don't actually have the desire to follow the Buddha's path, you won't really want to put the effort in, your focus in meditation will be poor, and you won't be curious enough to investigate your experience enough to actually reach any sort of awakening.

This is why it's important to ask...

## What is your actual desire?

If Buddhism appeals to you, I think it's important to deeply inquire into why. And that's not coming from a place of judgement, but a place of practicality. If you do not deeply desire the reason you're actually practicing, you not only won't likely get anywhere, but you may end up in a mental state far worse than you began with.

Here are some reasons I can think people would want to engage directly with Buddhist teachings:

- Something about the teachings is true and beautiful to them; something deep within them loves the Dharma
- They are deeply suffering
- They have a background in religion/spirituality/meditation that doesn't see the claims as antithetical to their current ontology
- They have reached the point in their lives where selflessness has naturally overtaken self-interest as their primary motivator
- They are willing to risk it all to understand the nature of reality (me)

If you don't fall into any of these camps, then what?

## What actually feels good?

- Trying my absolute hardest
- Believing in something
- Feeling connected with other people
- Absurd, goofy, and creative things that are nonetheless impactful
- Adrenaline rushes from running while listening to music
- Working through a complex issue

## What is most important?

- Paying attention to where your attention is, and directing it towards the things you want to see more of

## What are the ingredients of success?

## What other assumptions are buried under this mess?

The absolute best response that I've heard to this whole deal comes from a talk by Rob Burbea from 2014: [Questioning Awakening](https://hermesamara.org/resources/talk/2014-11-12-questioning-awakening). If you have gripes with the way I've addressed (or not addressed) anything here, I can almost guarantee that that this talk will cover them.
