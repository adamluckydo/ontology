# Sensing with Soul

At this point, the previous sections have given a general overview of Buddhism and some practical arguments for and against it. I personally had issues following the path as I understood it, but it could easily be argued that I simply didn't "fully" understand it. But if that's a possible (and extremely common) pitfall, perhaps there's a better way to reach the goal? And what _is_ the goal, anyway?

## The most important principles

- Be your own researcher: "Right now, what is helpful?"
- Extreme Ownership: If you feel badly, look for what you can do to handle the problem (even if it's not your fault).

- I believe everything the Buddha realized and taught about experience was true, but I specifically want to divide the things he said into three categories:

1. Conceptual Teachings
2. Ways of Looking
3. Personal Stances

Where I went wrong in my practice was in believing

### Ways of Looking

Valid ways of looking:

- Humans are a result of biological processes built on chemistry, which is built on physics, which is built on math, in a world that started with the Big Bang. There is no reason for this.
- I am a hero tasked with discovering what is important and making it happen
- I was put into this world as a form of punishment
- Everything is just chaos and trying to explain it is futile
- Existence is a cosmic joke; and you can be in on the joke if you just have fun

## Attention, and how self-improvement _actually_ works

Our experience is an ever-evolving process. In some ways this is obvious to us: Eating unhealthily will cause compounding health issues over time, working out consistently will make us more fit, and so on. But in many ways, particularly in reference to self-view and our view of others, we conceive of people as static entities. This person is X, they have Y personality, and my relationship with them is Z. This doesn't just apply to external things like people and objects, but to all phenomena. The concepts of Emptiness and Dependent Origination are actually extremely generalizable to our lives, even without hundreds or thousands of hours of meditation and spiritual inquiry.

- Intention (self-preservation, self-gratification, self-love, love for other beings, love for all phenomena, love without object, nondual love, love for image)
- Perception (phenomena only experienced as concepts, aware of sensations from the head, sensations aware of themselves, centerless awareness, Jhanas, cessation, imaginal sensations)
- Conception (I/me/mine and world, stark nihilism/eternalism, in-between conceptions, five aggregates / three characteristics, emptiness/nonduality, soulmaking/imaginal)

## The Middle Way of Desire

~ Neither what you "want" to do, nor what you "should" do

## Rumi

From _The Essential Rumi_, translated by Coleman Barks:

### On Gambling

_To a frog that's never left his pond the ocean seems like a gamble._
_Look waht he's giving up: security, mastery of his world, recognition!_
_The ocean frog just shakes his head. "I can't really explain waht it's like where I live, but someday I'll take you there."_

If you want what visible reality can give, you're an employee

If you want the unseen world, you're not living your truth.

Both wishes are foolish, but you'll be forgiven for forgetting that what you really want is love's confusing joy.

### Finding "Love's Confusing Joy"



## Two Kinds of Intelligence

There are two kinds of intelligence: one acquired,
as a child in school memorizes facts and concepts
from books and from what the teacher says,
collecting information from the traditional sciences
as well as from the new sciences.

With such intelligence you rise in the world.
You get ranked ahead or behind others
in regard to your competence in retaining
information. You stroll with this intelligence
in and out of fields of knowledge, getting always more
marks on your preserving tablets.

There is another kind of tablet, one
already completed and preserved inside you.
A spring overflowing its springbox. A freshness
in the center of the chest. This other intelligence
does not turn yellow or stagnate. It's fluid,
and it doesn't move from outside to inside
through conduits of plumbing-learning.

This second knowing is a fountainhead
from within you, moving out.

## Two Ways of Running

A certain man had a jealous wife
and a very, very appealing maidservant.

The wife was careful not to leave them alone,
ever. For six years they were never left
in a room together.
But then one day
at the public bath the wife suddenly remembered
that she’d left her silver washbasin at home.

“Please, go get the basin,” she told her maid.

The girl jumped to the task, because she knew
that she would finally get to be alone
with the master. She ran joyfully.
She flew,
and desire took them both so quickly
that they didn’t even latch the door.

With great speed they joined each other.
When bodies blend in copulation,
spirits also merge.

Meanwhile, the wife back at the bathhouse,
washing her hair, “What have I done!
I’ve set the cotton-wool on fire!
I’ve put the ram in with the ewe!”

She washed the clay soap off her hair and ran,
fixing her chador about her as she went.

The maid ran for love. The wife ran out of fear
and jealousy. There is a great difference.

The mystic flies moment to moment.
The fearful ascetic drags along month to month.

But also the length of a “day” to a lover
may be fifty thousand years!

You can’t understand this with your mind.
You must burst open!

Fear is nothing to a lover, a tiny piece of thread.
Love is a quality of God. Fear is an attribute
of those who think they serve God, but who are actually
preoccupied with penis and vagina.

You have read in the text where They love him
blends with He loves them.
Those joining loves
are both qualities of God. Fear is not.

What characteristics do God and human beings
have in common? What is the connection between
what lives in time and what lives in eternity?

If I kept talking about love,
a hundred new combinings would happen,
and still I would not say the mystery.

The fearful ascetic runs on foot, along the surface.
Lovers move like lightning and wind.
No contest.
Theologians mumble, rumble-dumble,
necessity and free will,
while lover and beloved
pull themselves
into each other.

The worried wife reaches the door
and opens it.
The maid, disheveled, confused, flushed
unable to speak.
The husband begins his five-times prayer.

The wife enters this agitated scene.
As though experimenting with clothes,
the husband holds up some flaps and edges.

She sees his testicles and penis so wet, semen
still dribbling out, spurts of jism and vaginal juices
drenching the thighs of the maid.
The wife slaps him
on the side of the head,
“Is this the way
a man prays, with his balls?
Does your penis
long for union like this?
Is that why
her legs are so covered with this stuff?”

These are good questions
she’s asking her “ascetic” husband!

People who renounce desires
often turn, suddenly,
into hypocrites!

## Where to now, St. Peter?

Rob Burbea's final talk, given weeks before he died in 2020, is less than five minutes long. I listen to it as a yearly tradition on Christmas Eve.

It speaks for itself: [Perfection and Christ's Blessing](https://hermesamara.org/resources/talk/2020-03-06-perfection-and-christs-blessing)
