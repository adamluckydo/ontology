# On Being Human

I watched _Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind_ the other day. It's one of Miyazaki's first films (released in 1984), and is still frequently lauded as one of the best animated films ever made. My take: Painfully slow-paced, wholesome. A product of its time (just like its reviewer).

And speaking of time: When's the last time you saw someone being brave?

To be brave, you have to know pain is coming, and still face it anyway. And there are only two reasons people will do that. Out of fear (because it’s their only option), or out of love (because they know it's worth it).

“See? Nothing to fear.”

Nausicaa, the main character of the film, is the quintessential idealist: She probably risks her life about 50 times over the course of the movie, and with so little self-concern that it's almost comical. Watching it, I caught myself thinking: "Man, if only anyone was like this in real life".

But actually, some people are like that in real life. So the real question: "Why aren't I like this in real life?"

Because: It's scary.

A few years ago, I saw a tweet that read simply:

"If you're so smart, why aren't you happy?"

Upon reading it, I quickly realized a couple of things:

1. I was not happy
2. As a former gifted kid, I was affronted

I was smart (or so I thought), I was trying my best, yet consistent happiness was nowhere to be found. Wtf life?!?

In theory, achieving happiness should be simple. It's pretty consistently correlated with three main things: Making healthier choices, feeling close with other people, and spending time doing meaningful work.

So what’s stopping us from just doing those things?

For starters: Life is unfair. At any time, misfortune can strike: Financial troubles, abusive relationships, health issues, the list goes on. And even when conditions do seem satisfactory (healthy finances, healthy relationships, free time and physical well-being), many people still consistently fail to live up to their aspirations (see: Me).

So again, what’s the issue? And more importantly, what's to be done?

Everyone is different, and everyone has different mountains to climb.

As for myself: My mountain is fear. And that fear has blocked me from feeling love, which is the real precursor to happiness.

Self-love incentivizes non-coercive healthy choices, love for others makes relationships close, and love for the world is the fuel for doing meaningful work.

I had initially intended this series of posts to be a rational analysis of Buddhism and ontology. Out of no real conscious choice of my own, the series has turned out more like a documentary, surveying my struggles on the battlefield of fear and love.

Over the course of the journey, we’ll meet a colorful cast of characters: Yours truly, The Buddha, and the man who quite possibly saved my life.

A word of warning before we begin:

This series is what my younger self would have benefitted most from reading. At risk of repeating myself: Everyone is different, and so will inevitably receive things differently.

Listen to your heart, and follow that above all else.

With that said: Let the battle commence.

## Two Kinds of Intelligence

From _The Essential Rumi_, translated by Coleman Barks:

There are two kinds of intelligence: one acquired,
as a child in school memorizes facts and concepts
from books and from what the teacher says,
collecting information from the traditional sciences
as well as from the new sciences.

With such intelligence you rise in the world.
You get ranked ahead or behind others
in regard to your competence in retaining
information. You stroll with this intelligence
in and out of fields of knowledge, getting always more
marks on your preserving tablets.

There is another kind of tablet, one
already completed and preserved inside you.
A spring overflowing its springbox. A freshness
in the center of the chest. This other intelligence
does not turn yellow or stagnate. It's fluid,
and it doesn't move from outside to inside
through conduits of plumbing-learning.

This second knowing is a fountainhead
from within you, moving out.
