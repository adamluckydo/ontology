# Battle of the Ontologies

Wow Adam, that essay on Buddhism was pretty cool! But unfortunately:

- I don't really get it
- I get it, but it's all bullshit
- I get it, but I hate it
- Why would you waste so much time on this, you poor soul
- I simply could not give a single rat's ass about any of this, but I'm still reading because I like you

If any of these are you, then you're not alone: I have felt literally all of these things over the past few years (except for the last one, but thank you if that's you).

This post is basically the culmination of all of my questions, concerns, investigations, and conclusions. I've tried to arrange the whole thing as a cohesive narrative, but since I'm touching on so many different points (and some people may not be able to stomach another full essay), I've also formatted it as an FAQ.

## Buddhism vs. Science

**First of all, how do you categorize Buddhism?**

I think this point is really important, so I'm putting it first.

Buddhism, like religion, philosophy, and science, is a mechanism that tries to convey truth. Take a look at this chart:

|                   | Objective Reality      | Subjective Reality |
|-------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| Claims of Fact    | Religion               | Buddhism           |
| Theories          | Philosophy             | Scienctific Method |

I can forsee a _lot_ of people looking at this chart and saying "wtf?", so let me clarify some definitions.

- Objective Reality: What is true _outside_ of our experience.
- Subjective Reality: What is true _inside_ of our experience.
- Claims of Fact: Beliefs that are treated as objectively true.
- Theories: Beliefs that aren't treated as objectively true.

Now, how each category matches those definitions:

First, religion: Religion makes claims of fact about objective reality. Religion is clearly not presented as a "theory", nor is it used in practice as one. It's faith-based. Religion is treated as a ground truth that can be depended on, and it explains the reality that exists independently of our conception of it.

Next, the scientific method: This one might be strange to some people, since science is supposed to be _the_ most reliable thing we have to determine what is real. And... I would agree with that. But, according to the actual scientific method: Experimental results, even if replicated a million times, are still theories, not "facts" (objective claims). They _could_ be proven false at any time, they just haven't been yet. Science, when done with integrity, is just "what was done" -> "what happened". The "what happened" bit is not some "objective reality" outside of what we experience. The only thing we know about "what happened" is what we saw/heard/felt/smelled/tasted. AKA: What we experienced. AKA: Our subjective reality.

Next, philosophy: Philosophy, like religion, attempts to describe what reality really is, outside of our subjective experience. Unlike religion though, philosophical claims are intended to be purely rational. And since we, as subjective experiencers, can't possibly verify if a philosophical claim about an objective reality outside of our experience is true, philosophical claims must remain as theories.

Finally, we have Buddhism. The reason it's so hard to categorize is because it's not _quite_ a religion and not _quite_ a science. What do I mean by that? Like the scientific method, Buddhism only deals with things in our subjective experience. It says "practice these things and these results happen". But unlike the scientifc method, it doesn't say "these results _have_ happened, but maybe they could be different". The Buddha said "all phenomena _are_ empty". In doing, so he was making an claim of fact about subjective reality.

### Why Buddhism over [insert religion here]?

As mentioned above, Buddhism isn't really a religion; it's apples to oranges. Religion attempts to declare facts about objective reality, whereas Buddhism declares facts about subjective reality. So it's quite possible to be a Christian Buddhist.

### Are science and Buddhism at odds?

Again, there's no overlap between these two where they even _could_ be at odds. Both the scientific method and Buddhism are based on running verifiable experiments on subjective reality and making claims based on their results. Anyone is free to run the Buddha's experiments of meditative inquiry and come up with different results, but that just hasn't happened yet.

There _is_ a difference between the two though. In science, everything is a "theory": As in, the claims should not be treated as objective fact. On the other hand, the Buddha _does_ makes objective claims.

I think the better question, and the one that most people are _really_ asking when they bring up science and objectivity as an argument against Buddhism, is...

### Are Scientific Materialism and Buddhism at odds?

This is where things get spicy.

Scientific materialism is the belief that objective reality is made of matter; the particles that make up our reality are fundamentally real and cause everything else to work the way it does.

It's important to clarify that scientific materialism is _not_ the same thing as the scientific method, and it's not "the results of the scientic method" either. Scientific materialism takes the theories we've come up with based on scientific experiments run on subjective reality, mixed them with subjective intuitions about how reality works, and claims that the amalgamation is objective reality.

In the chart, scientific materialism would fall under the "religion" category because it's claiming a fact about objective reality. In a sense, scientific materialism is the "religion of no religion", and its followers have a "faith in faithlessness".

As with other religions, there's not technically overlap between scientific materialism and Buddhism. It's very possible to be an athiestic Buddhist, for example.

But, since it'd be fun... why don't we try using the concepts of Buddhism to try to explain objective reality?

![Emptiness got hands](hands.jpg)

### Emptiness as Objective

If we look at modern physics, we can almost intuit emptiness without even knowing about Buddhism. Modern quantum mechanics seems to support the things the Buddha said two and a half millenia ago.

Remember, the fundamental concept underlying Buddhism is Emptiness: That things don't have an actual, inherent existence.

Even going back a hundred years, scientific material was already starting to lose it's footing.

Take Werner Heisenbarg. This was a hundred years ago, and physics has only gotten crazier since:

> What is an elementary particle? We say, for instance, simply “a neutron,” but we can
give no well-defined picture of what we mean by the word. We can use several pictures
and describe it once as a particle, once as a wave or as a wave packet. But we know that
none of these descriptions is accurate…. If one wants to give an accurate description of
the elementary particle … the only thing which can be written down is a probability
function [what I just talked about]. But then one sees that not even the quality of being
[that it ‘is’ or ‘is not’], if it may be called a quality, belongs to what is described.

I'm not a physicist though, so maybe my word doesn't count. But how about Niels Bohr, creator of the Bohr model of the atom and major contributor to quantum theory?

> “Everything we call real is made of things that cannot be regarded as real.”

But Bohr was a bit of a philosopher. Maybe, despite his genius, he was also inclined to believe in some outlandish things. How about someone we can _really_ trust: Albert Einstein.

> "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me that it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the old one. I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice."

A lot of people _hate_ Buddhism. I know I have at some points. In essence, it's "abandon everything because it's all suffering".

In a world where beliefs are so powerful... Why would anyone pick Buddhism? If you don't believe in scientific materialism, why not find a belief system that _supports_ human desire, or at least supports _anything_? And frankly, how does one even _find_ Buddhism? If you don't like Christianity, why not pick any other random eastern religion? And finally: What are the practical implications of practicing Buddhism? Is it just fancy dissociation? Are its goals realistically attainable?

All of these (and more) will be answered in this post.

## To do your duty as a human

Here's an excerpt from [one of Rob Burbea's talks](https://hermesamara.org/resources/talk/2011-12-31-this-matter-of-emptiness):

___

So the most fundamental fact about anything at all, and the most fundamentally important fact about anything at all, any experience at all, is that it is dependent on how I'm looking, how I'm aware of it. And as I said, that means it's empty. And that's the most fundamental and fundamentally important fact about anything. So we talk, I and all the teachers, we talk about 'what is,' and 'being with what is,' and 'opening to what is,' and all that. But is what is, what is? What? [laughter] There is no objective reality that we arrive at. And if you know anything about, for instance, quantum physics, and the discoveries of the last century and ongoing, very similar discoveries. The way we look conjures what we see, at the most basic level of reality.

Imagine going into a room. There's a person in the room, and they've got their back on the wall in a lot of fear. You just enter this room, and this person is stuck there with fear. And you think, "What on earth's going on?" And they say, "There's a wolf in the room." And you look -- I don't think this is going to work! You look at the wall, and you see -- can we have a little technical special effects? [laughter] No? Okay, leave it.

Yogi: Turn the lights down!

Rob: Just try the bottom ones at first, Annie, if you would, please. The bottom ones, yeah, thanks. Okay, let's try this. Aahhhh, it's a wolf! [laughter] Okay, and this person is terrified of the wolf. Can everyone see this scary wolf? [laughter] And you say, "Well, what's going on?" They say, "There's a wolf, but I'm being with the wolf. I'm being with the wolf, and I'm being with my fear, and I'm practising mindfulness, and I'm being with it." And you say, "... Okay." [laughter] And they're not seeing their other hand [creating the shadow of the wolf]. They're not seeing their other hand. They're stuck looking at the wolf. It's a silhouette, the hand shadow. If you're listening to this on tape, I was playing with a light and a hand shadow, and a terrifyingly realistic impression of a wolf. [laughter] They don't see their other hand. They don't see the fabrication that's going on, because I'm stuck looking at the wolf.

Maybe 'being with' this wolf and being with my process with the wolf, maybe equanimity comes, and maybe patience comes. But ultimately the suffering won't be undermined. It won't be cut at the deepest level. Maybe I'm with the wolf and the wolf disappears. And maybe -- could we have the lights again? [laughter] Sorry, Annie. It's a busy night for you! Okay, the wolf disappears, and then a bunny rabbit comes! [laughter] Nice bunny rabbit. There we go. [laughter, applause] Thank you. And then bunny rabbit, aahhhh, huge relief. It's a bunny rabbit. How lovely! And basically what happens is phew, relief.

But something has not been learnt. I haven't learnt anything. Just the next experience comes, without asking: how is it that the wolf appeared? How is it that the wolf disappeared? How is it that the bunny rabbit appeared and the bunny rabbit disappeared? And me, or you, as a person walking into that room, what's the most compassionate response? What's the most compassionate thing to say to this person? "Keep being with it"? Or "It's impermanent"? Or kind of, you know, "Maybe it's something releasing"?

And this is where we go back to this thing about appropriateness. Don't forget what I said about that. But ultimately speaking, what's the most compassionate thing? We can learn to see the concocting, and that is the main purpose of meditation practice. The main, if we talk about the deeper thrust, it's to learn to see this concocting. If we do that, I don't know if some of you maybe had the thought, "Oh, that means it's my fault, because I'm projecting this and I'm doing that." And then there can come some judgment: "Oh, you're saying suffering is my fault." No, because not only is the self not real enough to be found fault with, but also this process of concoction is just what consciousness does. It's what consciousness does. It's the way it works. Please remember as I say all this, there's something about timing. When is the right time to tell this person? When is the appropriate time to share with this person and point out to them, "Can you see your other hand? Can you see the process that's going on?"

## What exactly _is_ the Buddhist Path?

Here's an excerpt from one of the talks Rob Burbea gave at a [2008 retreat](https://hermesamara.org/resources/talk/2008-12-28-the-meaning-of-refuge):

> One of my teachers, Ajaan Geoff, said the path is based on a sense of fear, which when I first heard it, I was like, "Wow, that's really odd." Actually to have a very alive sense of danger and fear, it's a requirement for refuge. So the Buddha would encourage these kind of reflections, reflections on ageing, reflections on the fact of sickness, reflections on death, reflections on loss, on the inevitable growing separate from what and who we love. This is the nature of things, and so he said one should reflect, "I am subject to ageing, subject to sickness, subject to death, subject to loss. I have not gone beyond ageing, sickness, death." To really reflect on this. And then to reflect further: "I am not the only one subject to ageing, sickness, death, etc. All beings are subject to ageing, have not gone beyond ageing, sickness, death, loss."

Not only is Buddhism complex, heavy, and incredibly far out of the realm of our normal conception of existence, but even just hearing about it can strike people in unexpected ways. Furthermore, attempting to follow its doctrines it in earnest can be mentally destabilizing (even when practice is going "well"). At least, that's what happened to me.

Turns out, if you meditate a bunch and practice viewing all phenomena as suffering, it's possible to convince your brain that it is the truth. And the effects of doing that (at the very least with no preparation) are not good.

Specifically, the way it registered for me was like a sudden jolt of realization that everything was a trick. All good things, all bad things, every thing that _has_ happened or _will_ happen was just fake, and caring about any of it could only lead to suffering. You know how your brain will drift off into daydreams as soon as you're not focusing on something? Well every time that happened, instead of random thoughts about myself or others or the future or the past, it was just "this is all suffering". And the only thing that helped was to clear my mind by meditating, but the thought of being alone with my own mind was too overwhelmingly terrifying to allow myself to do even that. For a few weeks after the initial shift, I could not go to sleep without a light on and some audio playing to try to distract my mind from "the truth".

There were only two things that really pulled me out of it: Time, and Rob Burbea.

## Is the end of suffering the most important thing?

## Is the Buddha actually Anti-Life?

A lot of popular Buddhist teachings gently skip over the fact that the Buddha _despised_ phenomena. He frequently described the Five Aggregates as “inconstant, dukkha, a disease, a boil, an arrow, misery, an affliction, alien, a disintegration, empty, not-self” (e.g. 9:36 of the Numbered Discourses). The Buddha was not "against life" per se, but he was against suffering. Since life was composed of phenomena that are not free of suffering, that was that.

![Rival Voices on non-self](no_self.png)

## If everything is empty, how _isn't_ that Nihilism?

While all phenomena (including suffering) may be empty, the Buddha cared very much about the beings who were experiencing it. So for him, "meaning" was never a concern. Liberating all beings from suffering is a meaningful cause while still attached to a non-empty conception of meaning, and after enlightenment, "meaning" lost all meaning.

## Is Buddhism the Truth?

Is it possible for a human being to have _the_ Truth?

How can anything be real when we don't have access to reality?

"Real" is a category error just like "Truth" is. It's not something that even exists in our experience.

### Paradoxes

- Emptiness of all particles, what's fundamental? Time? Space?

### Provisional Truths

Einstein didn’t disprove Newtonian mechanics so much as identify it as a special case in a more general framework. Whatever future physics is, its first step will be to recreate the predictive power of the Standard Model

Einstein: “while general relativity might one day be superseded, the statistical theory of atoms will never be overthrown.”

[Romeo Stevens on Christianity vs. Buddhism](https://x.com/RomeoStevens76/status/1739807369171972588?s=20)

### FPS, no grabby-grab

Due to the way suffering works, much of our daily suffering can be directly reduced through meditation. Meditative practice

### Benefits of Buddhism

- Never lonely
- Always feel okay
- Better at modeling other people
- Easy to just do stuff
- Way less fear of death
- Can update your beliefs instantly if you want to
- Never bored

### The Most Practical Route to Emptiness?

[Rob Burbea on approaching Emptiness](https://hermesamara.org/resources/talk/2011-12-31-this-matter-of-emptiness).

## Will awakening cause you to lose your personality?

No, you will pretty much be unidentifiably different from before. I say this based on:

- Experience direclty interacting with awakened people
- Hearing accounts from awakened people
- Understanding the process of awakening itself at a general level

Nothing about meditation "removes" any part of your personality, but it may make you a bit more awkward if you spend all of your time meditating without socializing.

## Is the work required to reach stream entry worth it?

[RivalVoices on ending suffering via Buddhism](https://x.com/nosilverv/status/1742311850836951201?s=20)

Who do you believe? If you believe your unawakened self, then almost definitely no. But I'd advise you to consider Plato's [Allegory of the Cave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69F7GhASOdM).

If you listen to any stream enterer, almost all will say that the shift that occurs was the most important event of their lives, bar none. And most will spend the rest of their lives trying to help other people experience the same.

Whether you personally should make the effort can only be a personal decision. Do you desire to try? And speaking of desire...

## Does the Buddha hate desire?

If you read the Four Noble Truths, it's pretty easy to draw the conclusion that desire is the root of all suffering. Therefore, the Buddha must think desire is bad.

Well, turns out, the Buddha also coined a listicle called "The Four Bases of Power". They are:

1. Desire
2. Effort
3. Focus
4. Inquiry

The Buddha noted these qualities specifically with respect to making progress on the path. Meaning: To free yourself from desire, you need desire. But if you look at that list again, those are qualities required to make progress in _anything_.

So if you don't actually have the desire to follow the Buddha's path, you won't really want to put the effort in, your focus in meditation will be poor, and you won't be curious enough to investigate your experience enough to actually reach any sort of awakening.

This is why it's important to ask...

## What is your actual desire?

[Nick Cammarata: "ah ok I'll save the world, that's special right!"](https://x.com/nickcammarata/status/1741561355264745778?s=20)

If Buddhism appeals to you, I think it's important to deeply inquire into why. And that's not coming from a place of judgement, but a place of practicality. If you do not deeply desire the reason you're actually practicing, you not only won't likely get anywhere, but you may end up in a mental state far worse than you began with.

Here are some reasons I can think people would want to engage directly with Buddhist teachings:

- Something about the teachings is true and beautiful to them; something deep within them loves the Dharma
- They are deeply suffering
- They have a background in religion/spirituality/meditation that doesn't see the claims as antithetical to their current ontology
- They have reached the point in their lives where selflessness has naturally overtaken self-interest as their primary motivator
- They are willing to risk it all to understand the nature of reality (me)

If you don't fall into any of these camps, then what?

## What actually feels good?

- Trying my absolute hardest
- Believing in something
- Feeling connected with other people
- Absurd, goofy, and creative things that are nonetheless impactful
- Adrenaline rushes from running while listening to music
- Working through a complex issue

## What is most important?

- Paying attention to where your attention is, and directing it towards the things you want to see more of

## Dangers

It's taken me up until... just about now, actually, to finally stop being scared of meditation post-incident.

## Is "Nirvana" actually an "end goal"?

The second-most famous Buddhist teacher, Nagarjuna, became famous due to his expansions on the teachings of emptiness. A couple of quotes:

"There exists no distinction at all between samsara and nirvana." (MMK 25:19)

"Those who do not see reality conceive samsara and nirvana; those who see reality conceive neither samsara and nirvana." (Yuktisastika)

The Buddha tended to speak of nirvana as an "ultimate goal"; an end to the cycle of rebirth. But... to speak of nirvana as a real goal, one that can be attained, is to reify it. Nagarjuna states that, if emptiness is _actually_ observed, even nirvana (permanent cessation) will be seen as just as empty as the world of appearances (samsara). So where does that leave us?

"Because everything is unconditioned, unproduced, and non-existent... all [phenomena] are the same as enlightenment." (Saptaśatikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra)

If everything is empty, then _any_ view is empty, even the view of emptiness.

So if it's all empty, what's the point of even doing _any_ of this investigation and practice in the first place?

I think Rob Burbea puts it well in the last words of his book, _Seeing that Frees_:

"When there is insight, we know that how and what we see are not simply givens, but are the colourable and malleable, magical, material of empty appearances.

There is space here, and space for reference and devotion. When we see the void -- the open and groundless nature of all things, the inseparability of appearances and emptiness -- we recognize anyway just how profound is our participation in this magic of appearances. Then whether fabrication, which is empty, is consciously intended in a certain direction or not, the heart bows to the fathomless wonder and beauty of it all. It can be touched by an inexhaustible amazement, touched again and again by blessedness and relief. In knowing fully the thorough voidness of this and that, of then and now, of there and here, this heart opens, over and over in joy, in awe and release. Free itself, it knows the essential freedom in everything."

## What other assumptions are buried under this mess?

The absolute best response that I've heard to this whole deal comes from a talk by Rob Burbea from 2014: [Questioning Awakening](https://hermesamara.org/resources/talk/2014-11-12-questioning-awakening). If you have gripes with the way I've addressed (or not addressed) anything here, I can almost guarantee that that this talk will cover them.

## Adam's Instructions for Meditation (and Living Well)

### Prerequisites

1. You must love yourself. If you do not love yourself, I recommend Sasha Chapin's [self-acceptance course](https://www.sashachapin.com/self-acceptance-course). If you don't like that idea, then try talking to your friends and family about how they learned to love themselves. I promise you'll get something out of it.
2. You must be able to reside in your body. River Kenna's [somatic resonance course](https://www.riverkenna.com/soma) is designed specifically for that. If you don't like that idea, then I recommend practicing yoga or some other form of exercise or movement where bodily awareness is key.

### Practice

1. Sit down in as comfortable of a position as possible. You should be able to relax _all_ of your muscles and not fall over. If this requires sitting in a chair with a back and armrests, fine. If it requires lying down flat, it's less ideal because it'll be really hard to focus, but also fine.
2. **Important**: Begin with an intention of kindness. You are doing this practice because you love yourself, and because doing the practice will make you feel better. This is not a background, fuzzy thing. Tell your body very clearly: "I am doing this for you" (with love).
3. As you set the intention of kindness, pay attention to how your body reacts. It should relax, and you should be able to place your attention on the feeling of that relaxation.
    - If your body _doesn't_ relax, you aren't loving yourself. Try step 2 again. If you absolutely can't get it to work, go back to step 1 of the prerequisites. This is not optional.
    - If you don't really understand what it means to place your attention on the feeling of relaxation in your body, try imagining what relaxing feels like, and then tune into the "good" feeling of it. If you still aren't clear about how that feels, go back to step 2 of the prerequisites. This is also not optional.
4. Once you have a baseline level of bodily attention, "meditation" begins. The "goal" is to feel as good (read: relaxed) as you possibly can while your attention rests on your body. Don't do anything else. When you get distracted or tense, just notice it when you notice it (you can't control when that happens), and relax your attention back on your body again. The distractions, and I am not just being "nice" here, are literally an important part of the process.
    - If you're new, this is probably a good place to stop, even if you go for 10-20 minutes. A lot of the time, trying too many new things actually has adverse effects.
    - If you constantly get distracted by emotions (frustration, anxiety, guilt) while meditating, you aren't loving yourself. Try step 2 again. If you absolutely can't get it to work, go back to step 1 of the prerequisites. This is not optional.
5. If you're more advanced, or want to try something new, the next step is to take an explicit stance towards the sensations you're paying attention to. Specifically, the stance of "Welcome :)". As sensations in your body arise, notice each one and accept it as much as you possibly can. The reason this is a more advanced technique is because "doing" anything in meditation is counterintuitive. It's very easy to try to welcome everything by paying as MUCH attention to it as possible. If you push your attention directly into sensations saying "YOU ARE A SENSATION. WELCOME TO MY AWARENESS!", your body will _not_ relax, and the meditation will be uncomfortable and annoying. "Welcome :)" is like a feather-light attention; your awareness should gently graze the sensations, sensuously allowing them in to your cozy abode of bodily relaxation. If you can pull this off, "bad" sensations will lose the edge that makes them feel bad.
6. If you're extra advanced, try noticing the shape and size of your field of awareness. When you first start meditating, you might only be able to pay attention to one spot on your body at a time, and that spot might jump around sporadically. But as you progress, you can notice that the feeling of your whole body is already in awarness without having to do anything else. And not only that, but sounds and all of the other senses are there too. And then you might even notice the feeling of "looking" at sensations; a contraction in the back of your head that's always there because you're "paying attention", and you can relax that too. Eventually, your attention will just be equivalent to everything in the field of awareness.

### Bringing Practice into Life

1. Once you're able to regularly tune into your body and make it feel good in meditation, it's time to tune into your body in real life. Your body always knows _what_ to do, and your head always knows _how_ to do it. When it's safe, instead of relying on your head to decide everything, let the body take charge. Isabel from Mind Mine has [a fantastic post](https://mindmine.substack.com/p/head) on this.
2. You'll know when you're actually letting your body call the shots because doing things will feel _good_. Not just physically, but emotionally as well. You'll feel more confident in the things you're saying and doing, which enables you to do fun stuff, like, say, [writing a tweet like this](https://twitter.com/eigenrobot/status/1747448124396757077).
3. When you're embodied, you feel powerful and in control, and this does _magic_ for your well-being. You feel allowed, maybe for the first time ever, to believe the things you secretly want to believe. For example, I'm fond of [Vivid Void's Ontology](https://x.com/VividVoid_/status/1730709020741386708?s=20).

If you're just beginning meditation, I recommend Rob Burbea's retreat on [Unbinding the Heart](https://hermesamara.org/resources/all/retreat/Unbinding%20the%20Heart). Another world awaits.
