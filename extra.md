## Brass Tacks

There is suffering when there is clinging. Just by being alive, there is some amount of clinging. A person _can_ achieve nirvana and be free of suffering forever.

But what if some suffering is worth it?

Humans suffer when they lack two things: Safety and love. Suffering happens when they don't feel like they have those.

There is no way to _ever_ be safe, if "safety" means "not dying". Likewise, the needs of love are infinitely expanding.

The only way to resolve these needs forever is to remove the need for them (via seeing the emptiness of the self), or even "better", by preventing those needs from ever arising in the first place (by achieving nirvana).

But what do we do before we're there? Or maybe more importantly, what if we don't want to do that at all?

Why not focus on fulfilling those needs directly?

"War and courage have done more great things than charity. Not your sympathy, but your bravery hath hitherto saved the victims." - Friedrich Nietzsche, _Thus Spoke Zarathustra_ [1]

Nietzsche[2]:

The higher it’s type, always the seldomer doth a thing succeed. Ye higher men here, have ye not all - been failures? Be of good cheer; what doth it matter? How much is still possible! Learn to laugh at yourselves, as ye ought to laugh!

What wonder even that ye have failed and only half-succeeded, ye half-shattered ones! Doth not - man’s future strive and struggle in you? Man’s furthest, profoundest, star- highest issues, his prodigious powers - do not all these foam through one another in your vessel? What wonder that many a vessel shattereth! Learn to laugh at yourselves, as ye ought to laugh! Ye higher men, oh, how much is still possible! 

And verily, how much hath already succeeded! How rich is this earth in small, good, perfect things, in well-constituted things! Set around you small, good, perfect things, ye higher men. Their golden maturity healeth the heart. The perfect teacheth one to hope.

## Commmon Threads

Goals:
- Moving away from concepts
- Moving closer to experience: Physical body & emotions


How to get there:
- Direct path


## The Middle Way of Desire

With desire inherently comes clinging. If you have a preference of something, _anything_, you will suffer. Consider these two cases: If you don't have your preference, you will suffer until you get it, and if you _do_ have it, you will suffer in fear of losing it (since all things are impermanent).

If you truly want 0 suffering, the Buddha laid out a very effective path to extinguishing desire.

However, if the meaning inherent in desire is important to you, there's an orientation you can take that minimizes unnecessary suffering (from desires that aren't actually your most important ones).

### Start with Okayness

- Three arrows going up: Need, Want, Should
- Horizontal line of "Okayness" above where the need/should lines curve
- Need: Arrow curves to the left
  - "Things will only be ok if this happens"
- Should: Arrow curves to the right
  - "Things will not be ok unless this happens"
- Want: Arrow going straight up
  - "Things are okay regardless of if this happens, but I am intentionally signing the yearning waiver"
    - BY CHOOSING THIS DESIRE, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF FEELING BOTH SUFFERING AND MEANING

But what if things _aren't_ ok?

### Defeat yourself

Literally. This is the "hard" step. There's no way to move from "not okay" to "okay" without a volitional action,and this is the most direct possible way to do it. There's only one step:

Don't take your own side.

Stop caring about what you have to say about why things aren't okay. If you can do this, things will be okay. If you can't do this, things won't be okay.

This can also be looked at as a selflessness instruction. If you get past the idea of your "self" being a real thing that needs catering to, everything is already okay.

## The most important principles

- Beginner's Mind: If all else fails, foget everything you know and see where it takes you.
- Reality is what you believe it is.
  - Middle way of reality: Neither objective nor subjective
  - Shaped by external forces _and_ the actions you take
- Increasing well-being is possible
  - Feeling good / being happy is not a permanent state
    - If you pay attention to your actual life experience, you will realize that no state, good or bad, is permanent
  - Well-being is also not zero-sum. Some people are net positive happiness over the course of their lives, and other people are net negative
- All beliefs are empty & dependently originating
  - The only time to interpret a belief or story is in the present moment
  - Any given narrative doesn't have a real existence, so check whether your narratives are actually helpful
  - Another way of putting it: We are not inherently "some way". Our minds are just simulation/projection machines built on tautologies. If you act differently than the way "you are", you are now "that way"
- You have the power to shape the reality you want to live in
  - Extreme Ownership: If you feel badly, look for what you can do to handle the problem (even if it's not your fault).
  - Be your own researcher: "Right now, what is helpful?"
- Move towards what you do want instead of away from what you don't
  - Motivations: Goals (I want to do this) are "towards", expectations (I need to do this OR ELSE) are "away"
  - Pay close attention to what is actually going through your head on a daily basis
    - Both your internal monologue AND the text/music/videos/etc. your senses are ingesting
  - Everything is always shaping your perceptions, conceptions, and intentions, and those are all shaping each other
- How to know what to move towards?
  - "Sensing with soul" is a skill that can be developed
    - Takes your whole being into account: Combination of thinking, feeling, and gut instinct
    - Middle way of desire: Neither what you "want" to do, nor what you "should" do
  - If you don't know what is helpful, you have no option but to try new things
- Trying new things is a balancing act
  - Our minds naturally move towards what we know will bring us happiness: local maxima
  - It's also very likely that there is a greater happiness if we try new things: absolute maxima
  - One idea: enjoy the local maxima to the fullest (i.e. "make every moment count") but to not be afraid in our search for the absolute maximum (i.e. "follow your truth")
- The way to hard things is through them
  - Showing yourself that you can live through the hard things is what makes them disappear
  - The fear of the thing is what's causing the problem, not the thing itself
  - Everything that comes up needs to be understood, accepted, and loved, because it's all part of you
- Again: Reality is something that can be shaped

I think teaching Buddhism exactly as the Buddha taught in the modern western world is a terrible idea.

- I believe everything the Buddha realized and taught about experience was true, but I specifically want to divide the things he said into three categories:

1. Conceptual Teachings
2. Ways of Looking
3. Personal Stances

- Buddhism's conceptual teachings are useful across the board. Understanding "objective" facts is great as long as those facts don't lock you in to a certain mode of thinking. Luckily, Emptiness and Dependent Origination are specifically designed to be concepts that lead to their own unbinding in addition to the unbinding of all other modes of conceptualizing.
- Ways of Looking should _not_ be reified as objective facts. Instead, things like The Five Aggregates and The Three Characteristics are like pairs of glasses you can put on and take off at will. The point of different Ways of Looking is to practice with and recognize the malleability of perception: experience is not _really_ this or that way, but can be shaped in ways that are more or less helpful.
- Personal Stances are just that: entirely personal. They have no bearing on "objective" reality, nor should they be used as a teaching mechanism to influence what people believe or practice. The Buddha, after the experience of his entire life (and lives before that if you believe in reincarnation), decided that the ultimate goal was to reduce suffering, and he found that going beyond existence and nonexistence was the best way to do that. His goals are not your goals. If any person looks deep inside and determines that reducing suffering is the _most_ important thing to them, they may have the same goal. But almost every human is unique, so their personal stances, and therefore their goals, will all be unique.

### Ways of Looking

[Aaron Nesmith-Beck on Burbea](https://x.com/anesmithbeck/status/1728204114528698845?s=20)

Valid ways of looking:

- Humans are a result of biological processes built on chemistry, which is built on physics, which is built on math, in a world that started with the Big Bang. There is no reason for this.
- You are a hero tasked with discovering what is important and making it happen
- You were put into this world as a form of punishment
- Everything is just chaos and trying to explain it is futile
- Existence is a cosmic joke; and you can be in on the joke if you just have fun

### Another Way of Looking: Soulmaking

(Just one more framework bro.jpg)
(XKCD competing frameworks)

You don't need a framework, the answer is literally right in front of your nose.

The direct path:

- Everything on this list applies specifically in the moment, not looking back or predicting how things _will_ be
- #1 priority: Be mindful of your revealed intentions (not the ones you tell yourself)
  - Desire, intention, and action, are all actually the same thing. You always act according to your _actual_ desires/intentions, so paying attention to how you're acting reveals your actual underlying intentions
  - How to align stated intentions with revealed intentions? Helpful to think in terms of parts (IFS, MMM). One part of you might say you want something, but another part is resistant.
    - Your parts probably want to protect you from painful feelings/thoughts/memories
    - Having a deep reservoir of love and safety to give to these parts is what will actually allow them to release their protective barriers
- If you feel "wrong", that's where to make changes
  - "Wrong" is specifically _not_ "bad", like pain or grief or anger. Emotions are right, dissonance is not
  - What feels the most scary is usually the thing you need to do.
- How to know what feels "right"
  - Are you able to get into flow state?
  - If you're honest with yourself, does it feel like you're using your gifts well?


- If all ways of looking are empty, why not pick one up that aligns with your deepest goals and values?
- General direction: Movement towards more attention on love / less on safety
- Where to start: Move from self-preservation -> self-gratification -> self-love
  - Practice: Pay attention to what you're paying attention to (mindfulness) to notice where you're stuck in fear-based mindsets
  - Work: Spend time working towards the cool things you quietly dream of doing. Even if nothing comes of it, you're building an important sense of agency
    - How do you know if it's the right kind of work?
      - Wrong: If it's mostly instrumental (e.g. money, status, even something as good as helping others)
      - Right: If it's an art. Does it feel like you're actually expressing your gifts/feelings/truth?
    - Self-belief: If you're rationalizing paranoia about the ways you could fail, you've already lost.
      - Pay attention: Are other people as good at what you're doing as you are?
      - If you work hard enough at anything, you _will_ get good at it. If it's something you actually care about, you will succeed.
  - Reconnect with your physical being: [The Somatic Resonance course](https://www.riverkenna.com/soma) by River Kenna is great (and he's doing great work so support him if you feel so inclined)
  - Figure out how to feel love: [This article](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/how-i-attained-persistent-self-love) by Sasha Chapin is a great starting point, and he also offers a course specifically on self-acceptance
- How to grow: Curiosity, sensitivity, responsiveness, and experimentation

## Attention, and how self-improvement _actually_ works

Our experience is an ever-evolving process. In some ways this is obvious to us: Eating unhealthily will cause compounding health issues over time, working out consistently will make us more fit, and so on. But in many ways, particularly in reference to self-view and our view of others, we conceive of people as static entities. This person is X, they have Y personality, and my relationship with them is Z. This doesn't just apply to external things like people and objects, but to all phenomena. The concepts of Emptiness and Dependent Origination are actually extremely generalizable to our lives, even without hundreds or thousands of hours of meditation and spiritual inquiry.

- Intention (self-preservation, self-gratification, self-love, love for other beings, love for all phenomena, love without object, nondual love, love for image)
- Perception (phenomena only experienced as concepts, aware of sensations from the head, sensations aware of themselves, centerless awareness, Jhanas, cessation, imaginal sensations)
- Conception (I/me/mine and world, stark nihilism/eternalism, in-between conceptions, five aggregates / three characteristics, emptiness/nonduality, soulmaking/imaginal)
