# The Path of Fear

## One Thinky Boi

When I was younger, I always liked mazes. I particularly liked the challenge of only drawing lines once I had them completely solved. Now, I'm slowly realizing that solving everything in my head probably had some consequences _beyond_ just math teachers complaining that I never showed my work.

Looking back, thinking has always been my happy place. School quickly installed me with the “intelligence = self-worth” wiring, and at the same time, I realized that sharing feelings was dangerous. Speaking my mind sometimes caused people to react badly, so I learned to manage the thoughts I spoke out loud in order to keep people happy. After all, optimization was fun.

So it was fine that I mostly kept to myself in middle school, and that I was too shy to spend time with new people in high school... and in college. I still saw my old friends, and anyway, getting a good job was priority #1. In the meantime, digging into a creative problem was like cocaine for my brain: Every solution a fresh hit. “YES. I'm smart. This is what it's all about.”

Sometime around 2016, during college (coincidentally around the time I was forced to start making my own life decisions), my mind raised a problem of a new kind:

“What is the meaning of life?”

Why is it a question that’s so hard to take seriously? Because it’s ever-present? The unspoken agreement that it's unsolvable? The implicit assumption that meaning isn't real? The otherwise intolerable tension of existential dread? Or maybe... because for all of those reasons and more, to even ask the question is to admit that you're struggling.

At the time, the question seemed like a perfectly reasonable thing to genuinely ask and try to answer. To me, if it had a question mark, it was solvable. And I was a guy who could solve things. This was the first time I had ever been concerned about meaning or existence, and my brain rationalized the reason for that nicely:

“If I have to start deciding how I want to live my life, I obviously have to make the right decisions. And if I don't know what's actually meaningful, how can I know which decisions are the right ones?”

The question pittered around in the back of my head for a couple of years as I worked my way through college, and I eventually settled on an answer that suited me: “The meaning of life is to find a meaning in life”. And with brimming satisfaction at my own recursive prowess, I was placated.

Thinking wins again.

2020 arrived. I had landed a good software engineering job, and things were going pretty alright. I saw my friends less often than I had in college, but at least I was seeing coworkers at the office and regulars at the gym. Then Covid hit.

Suddenly, I was utterly isolated: Working from home, exercising alone at my apartment's gym, and filling in any free time with video games. Sensing the interpersonal void growing inside, I resorted to “the apps” (dating). As usual, I cluelessly applied my normal strategy: Be myself, but only on the condition that everything I spoke had to be manufactured to perfection.

On one fateful afternoon, after about 6 months of continuous isolation and self-sabotage, I happened to flex my psoas (AKA the “fear” muscle) in a way it really, _really_ didn’t agree with. After an explosion of pain in my right hip, suddenly I was left with chronic pain and an inability to feel anything from sex.

As any 20-something male would do, I tried to fix the problem by any means necessary:

Physical therapy, doctors, X-rays, MRIs...

Acupuncture, yoga, chiropractors...

Trying...

Waiting...

Losing hope,

Losing reasons to live.

Neither myself nor the specialists I went to were up to the task. And so, the great question of the the condition of my existence again reared its head: this time with extra nihilism.

I needed more than some transient meaning now. What was actually real? What could I rely upon when both my physical and cognitive abilities were failing in the present, and the future of my current trajectory was worse?

Coincidentally, a friend had recently introduced me to Waking Up, a sort of new-agey meditation app focused on self-investigation. And so, once again I found my refuge in thinking: This time by investigating the nature of my own experience.

After all, I was a guy who could solve things. Why not life itself?

## Solutionville?

The Waking Up app was cool; for the first time ever I got to hear people who seemed similarly interested in really deeply questioning what it means to exist. Even then, most parts of the app fell short of exactly what I was looking for. Practices and pointers were only so enticing; I wanted _answers_, damnit.

After listening to the series on Stoicism, I had just about had it. I remember leaving a mental review: “Very solid coping mechanisms for nerds”. Coping with reality was maybe enough for the Stoics. For myself: I needed more.

Finally, I stumbled upon a series of Buddhist Dharma talks by Joseph Goldstein called “The Path of Insight”. At first, it sounded like a bunch of religious dogma: “Be kind to thy neighbor” and whatnot. But as I continued hitting play, I started realizing something: "Wait, this is actually a science? Of subjective experience? And not only is it a science, but it's a _solved_ science? The Buddha just _has_ the answers, and it turns out those answers solve suffering for good?!?” Buddhism seemed to have an entirely different level of insight, practicality, and scientific rigor than anything else on the app.

## Discovering the Path

Buddhism is complex, heavy, and in a lot of ways, opposite of most people's conceptions of existence. Just hearing about it can be upsetting to some people. So consider this a disclaimer:

**Buddhism warning: Potentially distressing ontology ahead.**

A strange phenomenon sometimes occurs when somebody's closest loved ones pass away. For a few weeks or months, they may suddenly get interested in Buddhism, and then as the pain fades, so too does the interest. In the face of inconsolable grief, people are forced to encounter their suffering directly, and for a time, their perspective matches that of the Buddha's.

A quick introduction for Buddhism could look as follows: Life inherently has suffering in it, being free from suffering is the most important possible thing (implicit), and therefore we should transcend life itself. By investigating your own experience, you can see exactly how suffering originates and cut it off at its root.

At this point in time, I was already quite interested in understanding reality (as mentioned above). Since I was already on the path to finding Buddhism, all I needed was a little boost of suffering to push me off of the diving board and into the deep end.

According to the Buddha, one of the characteristics of existence is "dukkha", which more or less means "suffering". In any moment of perception, the Buddha says that there is some amount of suffering, and the way to get clear on that is to meditate on it.

As it turns out, if you practice viewing all phenomena as suffering while your brain is in a suggestible state, it's possible to convince your brain that suffering is "The Truth" (superseding all other truths). And from firsthand experience, I can tell you that the effects of that are exactly what you'd expect. The last few months of 2022 were by far the most miserable I've experienced in my entire life.

Specifically, what happened for me was a sudden jolt of realization that everything was a trick. All good things, all bad things, every thing that had happened or could happen was all fake, and caring about any of it could only lead to suffering. You know how your brain will drift off into daydreams as soon as you’re done with a task? Well every time that happened, instead of random thoughts about myself or others or the future or the past, it was just "this is all suffering". Even the thought of being alone with my own mind was overwhelmingly terrifying, so I attempted to distract myself, causing the fear to compound further. For a few weeks after my initial jolt, going to bed was a literal waking nightmare. My two options were: Keep the light on and listen to something until my body passed out (hours later), or brave the quiet darkness and face "The Truth", which typically kept me up just as long.

Another debilitating part of my mental shift was that it felt dangerous to even talk to other people about it. My paranoid logic told me that if I had gotten myself into this state, it was possible to get other people into this state by just telling them about it, and I had to avoid that at all costs. And to pour even more salt in the wound: I had no way to talk myself out of it. I hadn't convinced myself of it rationally, I had experienced it. So any thoughts along the lines of "just believe something different" were easily deflected by my self-imposed sphere of suffering.

There were only two things that really pulled me out of my state: Time, and Rob Burbea.

## Rob Burbea

I think I first discovered Rob Burbea through [@nickcammarata](https://twitter.com/nickcammarata) on Twitter. Nick — as he is wont to do — was recommending practicing the Jhanas: Meditative states of non-addictive bliss, attainable by the average person. I felt like I needed some of that, so I took his suggestion of learning by listening to the recordings from Burbea’s [Jhana retreat](https://hermesamara.org/resources/all/retreat/Practising%20the%20Jh%C4%81nas#%7B%22year%22%3A%22%22%2C%22retreat%22%3A%22Practising%2520the%2520Jh%25C4%2581nas%22%2C%22search%22%3A%22%22%7D).

Upon listening to some of the recordings, I was immediately impressed by Rob’s precise, thoughtful, and practical teachings. And even more importantly, the quality of his character and passion for his work spoke to a part of me that desperately needed it. And so, I downloaded his entire anthology of talks, put them on my phone, and the rest is history.

### About Rob

Rob was the resident teacher at Gaia House in England, teaching Buddhist insight meditation (and much, much more) from 2005 to 2015, at which point he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Rob continued to work with devotion until his passing in 2020.

If you want a fully-fledged introduction of Rob, his teachings, and the positive impact he's had on many people's lives, I highly recommend [this wonderful article from Tasshin](https://tasshin.com/blog/rob-burbea-ordinary-guy-werewolf-eternal-wanderer/).

These two quotes (pulled from Tasshin's article) give a good feel for the type of person Rob was:

> ... This playfulness with ways of looking and conceptual frameworks, an ability to play with and to entertain ideas, metaphysical ideas, even, without holding them and believing in them as true, or ‘this is reality,’ or whatever."

> "If we talk about self-images and the way self can be imaged, I could say, speaking a soul-truth if you like, from a soul perspective, I could say, ‘I am,’ in inverted commas: ‘I am a lover. I am a mystic. I am a scholar. I am a preacher. I’m a theoretical physicist. I am a political revolutionary. I am a wild sexual beast who is definitely not monogamous. I am a researcher into consciousness. I am a jazz musician. I’m a crazy poet. I’m a serious composer. I’m just an ordinary guy. I’m a teacher. I’m a student. I’m a monk. I’m a clown. I’m a vampire. I’m a wild man. I’m a werewolf. I’m a healer and a shaman. I’m some kind of fugitive, some eternal wanderer, outcast. I’m the tramp on the outskirts of town. I’m a lone soldier in a forever war.’
>
> Some of those I am or have been in my life conventionally. Some conventionally. All of them mythically. None of them really."

Rob brought a sense of magic that, combined with his intellectual rigor and deep dedication to action, introduced many people (myself included) to entirely new ways of seeing and living life.

At the time of my crisis, listening to Rob's talks was like clinging to a lifeline as I drowned at sea: He had seen Buddhism, walked the path himself, and gone beyond it. Maybe, just maybe, the reality of "The Truth" was a bit less real than I had thought.

And time went on.

___

My return to baseline okayness took about 3 months. As my self-induced paranoia faded, I decided it was time to finally face my external fears. And not because I had become better or more powerful or anything; I just really wanted to avoid ever being that miserable again, and I knew I'd feel better if I did the hard stuff I'd been avoiding.

I knew I wasn't done with Buddhism, and it wasn’t done with me. It had won this battle, but I knew I'd be back. I still had to solve reality, after all.

## Present Day, Present Time

It's been about a year since the incident, and my life is better in a lot of ways. And frankly, it's mostly just because I've been doing things that force me to talk to people more often.

And as for how I managed to make that happen... It was really just opening to the possibility that things could be better. I think listening to enough Rob Burbea will do that to you.

Looking back though: If I had to pick the one thing that made the biggest practical difference in turning things around, and the one thing I'd like anyone reading this to come away with, it's this:

**Our experience of reality is identical to what we believe reality is**. And conversely, our beliefs circumscribe what is possible in our lives.

For example, take my whole saga above. When I believed that existence itself was a horrible trick, my experience of life reflected that.

This goes for every belief. If you believe that life is inherently meaningless, your experience of life will inevitably reflect _that_, even if you’re desperately searching for some.

On the contrary, if you believe that your existence is meaningful, your deepest desires are achievable, and your life will be filled with joy... _While_ you believe those things, your experience of life will reflect those beliefs. And that’s different than saying that those things _will_ happen. It's worth thinking about.

___

Life is not this way or that way. There is no “objective” subjective experience. When you're experiencing life, you are always looking at it in a certain way, and that way of looking changes the actual experience of life itself.

It's taken me up until... just about now, actually, to finally shed my fear of meditating post-incident. During that recovery period, even just knowing the above was powerful for me. But knowing and experiencing are two different things. I figured: If I could understand the meta-level of why my experience was malleable, and how it could be shaped, I could essentially become the god of my own subjective experience.

And so, despite my harrowing experience, and maybe even because of it, I continued to investigate the Buddha’s teachings, and finally realized what he really meant by the end of suffering.
